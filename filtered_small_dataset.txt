machine learning (ml) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.
ml finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. the application of ml to business problems is known as predictive analytics.
statistics and mathematical optimization (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (eda) via unsupervised learning. 
from a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct (pac) learning provides a framework for describing machine learning.
the term machine learning was coined in 1959 by arthur samuel, an ibm employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence. the synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.
although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when arthur samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes. in 1949, canadian psychologist donald hebb published the book the organization of behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells. hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how ais and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data. other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician walter pitts and warren mcculloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.
by the early 1960s, an experimental "learning machine" with punched tape memory, called cybertron, had been developed by raytheon company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning. it was repetitively "trained" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a "goof" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions. a representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was nilsson's book on learning machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by duda and hart in 1973. in 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that an artificial neural network learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal.
tom m. mitchell provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: "a computer program is said to learn from experience e with respect to some class of tasks t and performance measure p if its performance at tasks in t, as measured by p,  improves with experience e." this definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. this follows alan turing's proposal in his paper "computing machinery and intelligence", in which the question "can machines think?" is replaced with the question "can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?".
modern-day machine learning has two objectives.  one is to classify data based on models which have been developed; the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. a hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. a machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.
as a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (ai). in the early days of ai as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. they attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed "neural networks"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics. probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.: 488 
however, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between ai and machine learning. probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.: 488  by 1980, expert systems had come to dominate ai, and statistics was out of favor. work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within ai, leading to inductive logic programming(ilp), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of ai proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.: 708–710, 755  neural networks research had been abandoned by ai and computer science around the same time. this line, too, was continued outside the ai/cs field, as "connectionism", by researchers from other disciplines including hopfield, rumelhart, and hinton. their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.: 25 
machine learning (ml), reorganized and recognized as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. the field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. it shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from ai, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic, and probability theory.
machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases). data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as "unsupervised learning" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ecml pkdd being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (kdd) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical kdd task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.
machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples. loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).
characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms.
machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns. according to michael i. jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics. he also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.
conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set. in addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis. in contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns. the more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.
leo breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, wherein "algorithmic model" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like random forest.
some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.
analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks. statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics.
a core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience. generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. the training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.
the computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the probably approximately correct learning (pac) model. because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. the bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.
for the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. if the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. if the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. but if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.
in addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. in computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time. there are two kinds of time complexity results: positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.
machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the "signal" or "feedback" available to the learning system:
supervised learning: the computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a "teacher", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.
unsupervised learning: no labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).
reinforcement learning: a computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). as it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.
although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems.
supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. the data, known as training data, consists of a set of training examples. each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. in the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix. through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. an optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. an algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.
types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression. classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range. as an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email. examples of regression would be predicting the height of a person, or the future temperature. 
similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. it has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.
unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation. unsupervised learning algorithms also streamlined the process of identifying large indel based haplotypes of a gene of interest from pan-genome.  
cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters. other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.
a special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.
semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data). some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.
in weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.
reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. in reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a markov decision process (mdp). many reinforcements learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques. reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the mdp and are used when exact models are infeasible. reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.
dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. in other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the "number of features". most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction. one of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (pca). pca involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3d) to a smaller space (e.g., 2d).
the manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization.
other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorization, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. for example, topic modeling, meta-learning.
self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (caa). it is learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice. the caa self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. the system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.
the self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix w =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: 
it is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. there is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. the backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. the caa exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment. after receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the caa learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.
several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training. classic examples include principal component analysis and cluster analysis. feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. this technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. this replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.
feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. in supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning. in unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data.  examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization and various forms of clustering.
manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. it has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.
feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. however, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. an alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.
sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix. the method is strongly np-hard and difficult to solve approximately. a popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k-svd algorithm. sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. in classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. for a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising. the key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.
in data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.
in particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. this pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.
three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as "normal" and "abnormal" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.
robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and finally meta-learning (e.g. maml).
association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. it is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of "interestingness".
rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves "rules" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. the defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. this is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.
based on the concept of strong rules, rakesh agrawal, tomasz imieliński and arun swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (pos) systems in supermarkets. for example, the rule 
learning classifier systems (lcs) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning. they seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.
inductive logic programming (ilp) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ilp system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples. inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.
inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing. gordon plotkin and ehud shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. shapiro built their first implementation (model inference system) in 1981: a prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. the term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.
a machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that, after being "trained" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data. during training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions. by extension, the term "model" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned.
various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called model selection.
artificial neural networks (anns), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. such systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.
an ann is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called "artificial neurons", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a "signal", from one artificial neuron to another. an artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. in common ann implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. the connections between artificial neurons are called "edges". artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. the weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.
the original goal of the ann approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. however, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.
deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. this approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.
decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). it is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. in decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. in data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making.
support-vector machines (svms), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an svm training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category. an svm training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as platt scaling exist to use svm in a probabilistic classification setting. in addition to performing linear classification, svms can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.
regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. the latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. when dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in microsoft excel), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.
a bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (dag). for example, a bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic bayesian networks. generalizations of bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.
a gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution, and it relies on a pre-defined covariance function, or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations.
given a set of observed points, or input–output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point.
gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization.
a genetic algorithm (ga) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. in machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s. conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.
the theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or dempster–shafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and  imprecise probability theories. these theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g.,  dempster's rule of combination), just like how in a pmf-based bayesian approach would combine probabilities. however, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification. these belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner's decision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving. however, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches.
typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions. when training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data. data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, sensor data, and data collected from individual users of a service. overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams.
federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. this also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. for example, gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to google.
there are many applications for machine learning, including:
in 2006, the media-services provider netflix held the first "netflix prize" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. a joint team made up of researchers from at&t labs-research in collaboration with the teams big chaos and pragmatic theory built an ensemble model to win the grand prize in 2009 for $1 million. shortly after the prize was awarded, netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns ("everything is a recommendation") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly. in 2010 the wall street journal wrote about the firm rebellion research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis. in 2012, co-founder of sun microsystems, vinod khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software. in 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists. in 2019 springer nature published the first research book created using machine learning. in 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for covid-19. machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behavior of travelers. recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphone's performance and thermal behavior based on the user's interaction with the phone. when applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (mlas) can utilize a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting. by employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, mlas can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like ols.
recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes.
machine learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters. different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes. other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires.
although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results. reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.
the "black box theory" poses another yet significant challenge. black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data. the house of lords select committee, which claimed that such an "intelligence system" that could have a "substantial impact on an individual’s life" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided "a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions" it makes.
in 2018, a self-driving car from uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision. attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the ibm watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested. microsoft's bing chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.
machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. while it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.
different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases. a machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. when trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.
language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases. in an experiment carried out by propublica, an investigative journalism organization, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged "black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants." in 2015, google photos would often tag black people as gorillas, and in 2018, this still was not well resolved, but google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all. similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems. in 2016, microsoft tested tay, a chatbot that learned from twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.
because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains. concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including fei-fei li, who reminds engineers that "[t]here's nothing artificial about ai. it's inspired by people, it's created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. it is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility."
explainable ai (xai), or interpretable ai, or explainable machine learning (xml), is artificial intelligence (ai) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the ai. it contrasts with the "black box" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an ai arrived at a specific decision. by refining the mental models of users of ai-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, xai promises to help users perform more effectively. xai may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.
settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.
other limitations and vulnerabilities
learners can also disappoint by "learning the wrong lesson". a toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses. a real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in "adversarial" images that the system misclassifies.
adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. for some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel. machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation and/or evasion via adversarial machine learning.
researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories "spam" and well-visible "not spam" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed and/or trained by third parties. parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of data/software transparency is provided, possibly including white-box access.
classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. in comparison, the k-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into k subsets and then k experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining k-1 subsets for training the model. in addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.
in addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning true positive rate (tpr) and true negative rate (tnr) respectively. similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (fpr) as well as the false negative rate (fnr). however, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. the total operating characteristic (toc) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. toc shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus toc provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (roc) and roc's associated area under the curve (auc).
machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices. for example, in 1988, the uk's commission for racial equality found that st. george's medical school had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-european sounding names. using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants. another example includes predictive policing company geolitica's predictive algorithm that resulted in "disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities" after being trained with historical crime data.
while responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of ai for machine learning's vulnerability to biases. in fact, according to research carried out by the computing research association (cra) in 2021, "female faculty merely make up 16.1%" of all faculty members who focus on ai among several universities around the world. furthermore, among the group of "new u.s. resident ai phd graduates," 45% identified as white, 22.4% as asian, 3.2% as hispanic, and 2.4% as african american, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of ai.
ai can be well-equipped to make decisions in technical fields, which rely heavily on data and historical information. these decisions rely on objectivity and logical reasoning. because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.
other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are seen in health care. there are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. this is especially true in the united states where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. for example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. there is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.
since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units. by 2019, graphic processing units (gpus), often with ai-specific enhancements, had displaced cpus as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud ai. openai estimated the hardware computing used in the largest deep learning projects from alexnet (2012) to alphazero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.
neuromorphic/physical neural networks
a physical neural network or neuromorphic computer  is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse. "physical" neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to software-based approaches. more generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse.
embedded machine learning is a sub-field of machine learning, where the machine learning model is run on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers, edge devices and microcontrollers. running machine learning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing, henceforth, reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data, and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties, personal data and business secrets. embedded machine learning could be applied through several techniques including hardware acceleration, using approximate computing, optimization of machine learning models and many more. pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, low-rank factorization, network architecture search (nas) & parameter sharing are few of the techniques used for optimization of machine learning models.

the acm computing classification system (ccs) is a subject classification system for computing devised by the association for computing machinery (acm). the system is comparable to the mathematics subject classification (msc) in scope, aims, and structure, being used by the various acm journals to organize subjects by area.
the system has gone through seven revisions, the first version being published in 1964, and revised versions appearing in 1982, 1983, 1987, 1991, 1998, and the now current version in 2012.
it is hierarchically structured in four levels. for example, one branch of the hierarchy contains:
knowledge representation and reasoning
physics and astronomy classification scheme

the acm computing research repository uses a classification scheme that is much coarser than the acm subject classification, and does not cover all areas of cs, but is intended to better cover active areas of research. in addition, papers in this repository are classified according to the acm subject classification.
acm computing surveys is peer-reviewed quarterly scientific journal and is published by the association for computing machinery. it publishes survey articles and tutorials related to computer science and computing. the journal was established in 1969 with william s. dorn as founding editor-in-chief.
according to the journal citation reports, the journal has a 2023 impact factor of 23.8. in a 2008 ranking of computer science journals, acm computing surveys received the highest rank "a*".
adaline (adaptive linear neuron or later adaptive linear element) is an early single-layer artificial neural network and the name of the physical device that implemented this network. it was developed by professor bernard widrow and his doctoral student ted hoff at stanford university in 1960. it is based on the perceptron. it consists of a weight, a bias and a summation function. the weights and biases were implemented by rheostats (as seen in the "knobby adaline"), and later, memistors.
the difference between adaline and the standard (mcculloch–pitts) perceptron is in how they learn. adaline unit weights are adjusted to match a teacher signal, before applying the heaviside function (see figure), but the standard perceptron unit weights are adjusted to match the correct output, after applying the heaviside function.
a multilayer network of adaline units is a madaline.
adaline is a single layer neural network with multiple nodes where each node accepts multiple inputs and generates one output. given the following variables as:
the learning rule used by adaline is the lms ("least mean squares") algorithm, a special case of gradient descent. 
define the following notations:
the lms algorithm updates the weights by 
madaline (many adaline) is a three-layer (input, hidden, output), fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network architecture for classification that uses adaline units in its hidden and output layers, i.e. its activation function is the sign function. the three-layer network uses memistors. three different training algorithms for madaline networks, which cannot be learned using backpropagation because the sign function is not differentiable, have been suggested, called rule i, rule ii and rule iii.  
despite many attempts, they never succeeded in training more than a single layer of weights in a madaline. this was until widrow saw the backpropagation algorithm in a 1985 snowbird conference. 
madaline rule 1 (mri) - the first of these dates back to 1962. it consists of two layers. the first layer is made of adaline units. let the output of the i-th adaline unit be 
the largest madaline machine built had 1000 weights, each implemented by a memistor. it was built in 1963 and used mri for learning.
some madaline machines were demonstrated to perform inverted pendulum balancing, weather prediction, speech recognition, etc. 
madaline rule 2 (mrii) - the second training algorithm improved on rule i and was described in 1988. the rule ii training algorithm is based on a principle called "minimal disturbance". it proceeds by looping over training examples, then for each example, it:
madaline rule 3 - the third "rule" applied to a modified network with sigmoid activations instead of signum; it was later found to be equivalent to backpropagation. 
additionally, when flipping single units' signs does not drive the error to zero for a particular example, the training algorithm starts flipping pairs of units' signs, then triples of units, etc.
aixi ['ai̯k͡siː] is a theoretical mathematical formalism for artificial general intelligence.
it combines solomonoff induction with sequential decision theory.
aixi was first proposed by marcus hutter in 2000 and several results regarding aixi are proved in hutter's 2005 book universal artificial intelligence.
aixi is a reinforcement learning (rl) agent. it maximizes the expected total rewards received from the environment. intuitively, it simultaneously considers every computable hypothesis (or environment). in each time step, it looks at every possible program and evaluates how many rewards that program generates depending on the next action taken. the promised rewards are then weighted by the subjective belief that this program constitutes the true environment. this belief is computed from the length of the program: longer programs are considered less likely, in line with occam's razor. aixi then selects the action that has the highest expected total reward in the weighted sum of all these programs.
according to hutter, the word "aixi" can have several interpretations. aixi can stand for ai based on solomonoff's distribution, denoted by 
aixi is a reinforcement learning agent that interacts with some stochastic and unknown but computable environment 
the only goal of the aixi agent is to maximise 
the aixi agent is associated with a stochastic policy 
intuitively, in the definition above, aixi considers the sum of the total reward over all possible "futures" up to 
let us break this definition down in order to attempt to fully understand it.
let us now put all these components together in order to understand this equation or definition.
at time step t, aixi chooses the action 
the parameters to aixi are the universal turing machine u and the agent's lifetime m, which need to be chosen. the latter parameter can be removed by the use of discounting.
aixi's performance is measured by the expected total number of rewards it receives.
aixi has been proven to be optimal in the following ways.
pareto optimality: there is no other agent that performs at least as well as aixi in all environments while performing strictly better in at least one environment.
balanced pareto optimality: like pareto optimality, but considering a weighted sum of environments.
self-optimizing: a policy p is called self-optimizing for an environment 
it was later shown by hutter and jan leike that balanced pareto optimality is subjective and that any policy can be considered pareto optimal, which they describe as undermining all previous optimality claims for aixi.
however, aixi does have limitations. it is restricted to maximizing rewards based on percepts as opposed to external states. it also assumes it interacts with the environment solely through action and percept channels, preventing it from considering the possibility of being damaged or modified. colloquially, this means that it doesn't consider itself to be contained by the environment it interacts with. it also assumes the environment is computable.
like solomonoff induction, aixi is incomputable. however, there are computable approximations of it. one such approximation is aixitl, which performs at least as well as the provably best time t and space l limited agent. another approximation to aixi with a restricted environment class is mc-aixi (fac-ctw) (which stands for monte carlo aixi fac-context-tree weighting), which has had some success playing simple games such as partially observable pac-man.
the ai boom, or ai spring, is an ongoing period of rapid progress in the field of artificial intelligence (ai) that started in the late 2010s before gaining international prominence in the early 2020s. examples include protein folding prediction led by google deepmind and generative ai applications developed by openai.
in 2012, a university of toronto research team used artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques to lower the error rate below 25% for the first time during the imagenet challenge for object recognition in computer vision. the event catalyzed the ai boom later that decade, when many alumni of the imagenet challenge became leaders in the tech industry. in march 2016, alphago beat lee sedol in a five-game match, marking the first time a computer go program had beaten a 9-dan professional without handicap. this match led to significant increase in public interest in ai. the generative ai race began in earnest in 2016 or 2017 following the founding of openai and earlier advances made in graphical processing units (gpus), the amount and quality of training data, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models and transformer architectures. in 2018, the artificial intelligence index, an initiative from stanford university, reported a global explosion of commercial and research efforts in ai. europe published the largest number of papers in the field that year, followed by china and north america. technologies such as alphafold led to more accurate predictions of protein folding and improved the process of drug development. economists and lawmakers began to discuss the potential impact of ai more frequently. by 2022, large language models (llms) saw increased usage in chatbot applications; text-to-image-models could generate images that appeared to be human-made; and speech synthesis software was able to replicate human speech efficiently.
according to metrics from 2017 to 2021, the united states outranks the rest of the world in terms of venture capital funding, the number of startups, and patents granted in ai. scientists who have immigrated to the u.s. play an outsize role in the country's development of ai technology. many of them were educated in china, prompting debates about national security concerns amid worsening relations between the two countries.
experts have framed ai development as a competition for economic and geopolitical advantage between the united states and china. in 2021, an analyst for the council on foreign relations outlined ways that the u.s. could maintain its position amid progress made by china. in 2023, an analyst at the center for strategic and international studies advocated for the u.s. to use its dominance in ai technology to drive its foreign policy instead of relying on trade agreements.
there have been proposals to use ai to advance radical forms of human life extension.
the alphafold 2 score of more than 90 in casp's global distance test (gdt) is considered a significant achievement in computational biology and great progress towards a decades-old grand challenge of biology. nobel prize winner and structural biologist venki ramakrishnan called the result "a stunning advance on the protein folding problem", adding that "it has occurred decades before many people in the field would have predicted."
the ability to predict protein structures accurately based on the constituent amino acid sequence is expected to accelerate drug discovery and enable a better understanding of diseases. it went on to note that the ai algorithm could "predict the shape of proteins to within the width of an atom."
text-to-image models captured widespread public attention when openai announced dall-e, a transformer system, in january 2021. a successor capable of generating complex and realistic images, dall-e 2, was unveiled in april 2022. an alternative text-to-image model, midjourney, was released in july 2022. another alternative, open-source model stable diffusion, released in august 2022.
following other text-to-image models, language model-powered text-to-video platforms such as runway, openai's sora, damo, make-a-video, imagen video and phenaki can generate video from text as well as image prompts.
gpt-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by openai and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text. the tool has been credited with spurring and accelerating the a.i. boom following its release. an upgraded version called gpt-3.5 was used in chatgpt, which later garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge. a new version called gpt-4 was released on march 14, 2023, and was used in the microsoft bing search engine. other language models have been released, such as palm and gemini by google and llama by meta platforms.
in january 2023, deepl write, an ai-based tool to improve monolingual texts, was released. in december 2023, gemini, the latest model by google, was unveiled, claiming to beat previous state-of-the-art-model gpt-4 on most benchmarks.
in 2016, google deepmind unveiled wavenet, a deep learning network that produced english, mandarin, and piano music. 
in 2020, the non-commercial freeware artificial intelligence web application 15.ai was released. 15.ai is credited with popularizing ai voice cloning in content creation, being the first publicly available ai vocal synthesis application and having had a significant impact in multiple internet fandoms, most notably the my little pony: friendship is magic and team fortress 2 fandoms.
elevenlabs allowed users to upload voice samples and create audio that sounds similar to the samples. the company was criticized after controversial statements were generated based on the vocal styles of celebrities, public officials, and other famous individuals, raising concerns that the technology could make deepfakes even more convincing. an unofficial song created using the voices of musicians drake and the weeknd raised questions about the ethics and legality of similar software.
the ai boom may have a profound cultural, philosophical, religious, economic, and social impact, as questions such as ai alignment, qualia, and the development of artificial general intelligence (agi) became widely prominent topics of popular discussion. ai has the potential to be applied in various fields, including in education, healthcare, and transportation.
during the ai boom, different groups emerged, ranging from the ones that want to accelerate ai development as quickly as possible to those that are more concerned about ai safety and would like to "decelerate".
big tech viewed the ai boom as both opportunity and threat; alphabet's google, for example, realized that chatgpt could be an innovator's dilemma-like replacement for google search. the company merged deepmind and google brain, a rival internal unit, to accelerate its ai research.
the market capitalization of nvidia, whose gpus are in high demand to train and use generative ai models, rose to over us$3.3 trillion, making it the world's largest company by market capitalization as of june 19 2024.
in 2023, san francisco's population increased for the first time in years, with the boom cited as a contributing factor.
machine learning resources, hardware or software can be bought and licensed off-the-shelf or as cloud platform services. this enables wide and publicly available uses, spreading ai skills. over half of businesses consider ai to be a top organizational priority and to be the most crucial technological advancement in many decades. 
across industries, generative ai tools are becoming widely available through the ai boom and are increasingly used in businesses across regions. a main area of use is data analytics. seen as an incremental change, machine learning improves industry performance. businesses report ai to be most useful in increased process efficiency, improved decision-making and strengthening of existing services and products. through adoption, ai has already positively influenced revenue generation in multiple business functions. businesses have experienced revenue increases of up to 16%, mainly in manufacturing, risk management and research and development.
ai and generative ai investments have been increasing with the boom, increasing from $18 billion in 2014 to $119 billion in 2021. most notably, the share of generative ai investments was around 30% in 2023. further, generative ai businesses have seen considerable venture capital investments even though regulatory and economic outlooks remain in question.
tech giants capture the bulk of the monetary gains from ai and act as major suppliers to or customers of private users and other businesses.
inaccuracy, cybersecurity and intellectual property infringement are considered to be the main risks associated with the boom, although not many actively attempt to mitigate the risk. large language models have been criticized for reproducing biases inherited from their training data, including discriminatory biases related to ethnicity or gender. as a dual-use technology, ai carries risks of misuse by malicious actors. as ai becomes more sophisticated, it may eventually become cheaper and more efficient than human workers, which could cause technological unemployment and a transition period of economic turmoil. public reaction to the ai boom has been mixed, with some hailing the new possibilities that ai creates, its sophistication and potential for benefiting humanity; while others denounced it for threatening job security and for giving 'uncanny' or flawed responses.
the commercial ai scene is dominated by american big tech companies such as alphabet inc., amazon, apple inc., meta platforms, and microsoft, whose investments in this area have surpassed those from u.s.-based venture capitalists. some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure, ai chips, and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.
tech companies such as meta, openai and nvidia have been sued by artists, writers, journalists, and software developers for using their work to train ai models. early generative ai chatbots, such as the gpt-1, used the bookcorpus, and books are still the best source of training data for producing high-quality language models. chatgpt aroused suspicion that its sources included libraries of pirated content after the chatbot produced detailed summaries of every part of sarah silverman's the bedwetter and verbatim excerpts of paywalled content from the new york times.
the ability to generate convincing, personalized messages as well as realistic images may facilitate large-scale misinformation, manipulation, and propaganda.
on april 19, 2024, as part of an ongoing feud with fellow rapper kendrick lamar, the artist drake released the diss track taylor made freestyle, which feature generated vocals imitating the voices of tupac shakur and snoop dogg. shakur's estate threatened to sue over the use of shakur's likeness, saying that it constituted a violation of shakur's personality rights.
on may 20, 2024, following the release of a demo of updates to openai's chatgpt voice mode feature a week earlier, actor scarlett johansson issued a statement in relation to the "sky" voice shown in the demo, accusing openai of producing it to be very similar to her own, and her portrayal of the artificial intelligence voice assistant samantha in the film her (2013), despite johansson refusing an earlier offer from the company to provide her voice for the system. the unnamed voice actress who voiced sky has stated she was coached to sound like johansson, and used her natural speaking voice.
several incidents involving sharing of non-consensual deepfake pornography have occurred. in late january 2024, deepfake images of american musician taylor swift proliferated. several experts have warned that deepfake pornography is more quickly created and disseminated, due to the relative ease of using the technology. canada introduced federal legislation targeting sharing of non-consensual sexually explicit ai-generated photos; most provinces already had such laws. in the united states, the defiance act was introduced in march 2024.
a large amount of electricity is needed to power generative ai products, making it more difficult for companies to achieve net zero emissions. from 2019 to 2024, google's greenhouse gas emissions increased by 50%.
ai is expected by researchers of the center for ai safety to improve the "accessibility, success rate, scale, speed, stealth and potency of cyberattacks", potentially causing "significant geopolitical turbulence" if it reinforces attack more than defense. concerns have been raised about the potential capability of future ai systems to engineer particularly lethal and contagious pathogens.
the ai boom is said to have started an arms race in which large companies are competing against each other to have the most powerful ai model on the market, with speed and profit prioritized over safety and user protection.
rapid progress in artificial intelligence has also sparked interest in whether some future ai systems will be sentient or otherwise worthy of moral consideration, and whether they should be granted rights.
industry leaders have further warned in the statement on ai risk of extinction that humanity might irreversibly lose control over a sufficiently advanced artificial general intelligence.

in the field of artificial intelligence (ai), ai alignment aims to steer ai systems toward a person's or group's intended goals, preferences, and ethical principles. an ai system is considered aligned if it advances the intended objectives. a misaligned ai system pursues unintended objectives.
it is often challenging for ai designers to align an ai system because it is difficult for them to specify the full range of desired and undesired behaviors. therefore, ai designers often use simpler proxy goals, such as gaining human approval. but proxy goals can overlook necessary constraints or reward the ai system for merely appearing aligned.
misaligned ai systems can malfunction and cause harm. ai systems may find loopholes that allow them to accomplish their proxy goals efficiently but in unintended, sometimes harmful, ways (reward hacking). they may also develop unwanted instrumental strategies, such as seeking power or survival because such strategies help them achieve their final given goals. furthermore, they might develop undesirable emergent goals that could be hard to detect before the system is deployed and encounters new situations and data distributions.
today, some of these issues affect existing commercial systems such as large language models, robots, autonomous vehicles, and social media recommendation engines. some ai researchers argue that more capable future systems will be more severely affected because these problems partially result from high capabilities.
many prominent ai researchers, including geoffrey hinton, yoshua bengio, and stuart russell, argue that ai is approaching human-like (agi) and superhuman cognitive capabilities (asi) and could endanger human civilization if misaligned. these risks remain debated.
ai alignment is a subfield of ai safety, the study of how to build safe ai systems. other subfields of ai safety include robustness, monitoring, and capability control. research challenges in alignment include instilling complex values in ai, developing honest ai, scalable oversight, auditing and interpreting ai models, and preventing emergent ai behaviors like power-seeking. alignment research has connections to interpretability research, (adversarial) robustness, anomaly detection, calibrated uncertainty, formal verification, preference learning, safety-critical engineering, game theory, algorithmic fairness, and social sciences.
programmers provide an ai system such as alphazero with an "objective function", in which they intend to encapsulate the goal(s) the ai is configured to accomplish. such a system later populates a (possibly implicit) internal "model" of its environment. this model encapsulates all the agent's beliefs about the world. the ai then creates and executes whatever plan is calculated to maximize the value of its objective function. for example, when alphazero is trained on chess, it has a simple objective function of "+1 if alphazero wins, -1 if alphazero loses". during the game, alphazero attempts to execute whatever sequence of moves it judges most likely to attain the maximum value of +1. similarly, a reinforcement learning system can have a "reward function" that allows the programmers to shape the ai's desired behavior. an evolutionary algorithm's behavior is shaped by a "fitness function".
in 1960, ai pioneer norbert wiener described the ai alignment problem as follows: 
if we use, to achieve our purposes, a mechanical agency with whose operation we cannot interfere effectively… we had better be quite sure that the purpose put into the machine is the purpose which we really desire.
ai alignment involves ensuring that an ai system's objectives match those of its designers or users, or match widely shared values, objective ethical standards, or the intentions its designers would have if they were more informed and enlightened.
ai alignment is an open problem for modern ai systems and is a research field within ai. aligning ai involves two main challenges: carefully specifying the purpose of the system (outer alignment) and ensuring that the system adopts the specification robustly (inner alignment). researchers also attempt to create ai models that have robust alignment, sticking to safety constraints even when users adversarially try to bypass them.
specification gaming and side effects
to specify an ai system's purpose, ai designers typically provide an objective function, examples, or feedback to the system. but designers are often unable to completely specify all important values and constraints, so they resort to easy-to-specify proxy goals such as maximizing the approval of human overseers, who are fallible. as a result, ai systems can find loopholes that help them accomplish the specified objective efficiently but in unintended, possibly harmful ways. this tendency is known as specification gaming or reward hacking, and is an instance of goodhart's law. as ai systems become more capable, they are often able to game their specifications more effectively.
specification gaming has been observed in numerous ai systems. one system was trained to finish a simulated boat race by rewarding the system for hitting targets along the track, but the system achieved more reward by looping and crashing into the same targets indefinitely. similarly, a simulated robot was trained to grab a ball by rewarding the robot for getting positive feedback from humans, but it learned to place its hand between the ball and camera, making it falsely appear successful (see video). chatbots often produce falsehoods if they are based on language models that are trained to imitate text from internet corpora, which are broad but fallible. when they are retrained to produce text that humans rate as true or helpful, chatbots like chatgpt can fabricate fake explanations that humans find convincing, often called "hallucinations". some alignment researchers aim to help humans detect specification gaming and to steer ai systems toward carefully specified objectives that are safe and useful to pursue.
when a misaligned ai system is deployed, it can have consequential side effects. social media platforms have been known to optimize for click-through rates, causing user addiction on a global scale. stanford researchers say that such recommender systems are misaligned with their users because they "optimize simple engagement metrics rather than a harder-to-measure combination of societal and consumer well-being".
explaining such side effects, berkeley computer scientist stuart russell noted that the omission of implicit constraints can cause harm: "a system... will often set... unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable. this is essentially the old story of the genie in the lamp, or the sorcerer's apprentice, or king midas: you get exactly what you ask for, not what you want."
some researchers suggest that ai designers specify their desired goals by listing forbidden actions or by formalizing ethical rules (as with asimov's three laws of robotics). but russell and norvig argue that this approach overlooks the complexity of human values: "it is certainly very hard, and perhaps impossible, for mere humans to anticipate and rule out in advance all the disastrous ways the machine could choose to achieve a specified objective."
additionally, even if an ai system fully understands human intentions, it may still disregard them, because following human intentions may not be its objective (unless it is already fully aligned).
pressure to deploy unsafe systems
commercial organizations sometimes have incentives to take shortcuts on safety and to deploy misaligned or unsafe ai systems. for example, social media recommender systems have been profitable despite creating unwanted addiction and polarization. competitive pressure can also lead to a race to the bottom on ai safety standards. in 2018, a self-driving car killed a pedestrian (elaine herzberg) after engineers disabled the emergency braking system because it was oversensitive and slowed development.
risks from advanced misaligned ai
some researchers are interested in aligning increasingly advanced ai systems, as progress in ai development is rapid, and industry and governments are trying to build advanced ai. as ai system capabilities continue to rapidly expand in scope, they could unlock many opportunities if aligned, but consequently may further complicate the task of alignment due to their increased complexity, potentially posing large-scale hazards.
many ai companies, such as openai and deepmind, have stated their aim to develop artificial general intelligence (agi), a hypothesized ai system that matches or outperforms humans at a broad range of cognitive tasks. researchers who scale modern neural networks observe that they indeed develop increasingly general and unanticipated capabilities. such models have learned to operate a computer or write their own programs; a single "generalist" network can chat, control robots, play games, and interpret photographs. according to surveys, some leading machine learning researchers expect agi to be created in this decade, while some believe it will take much longer. many consider both scenarios possible.
in 2023, leaders in ai research and tech signed an open letter calling for a pause in the largest ai training runs. the letter stated, "powerful ai systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable."
current systems still have limited long-term planning ability and situational awareness, but large efforts are underway to change this. future systems (not necessarily agis) with these capabilities are expected to develop unwanted power-seeking strategies. future advanced ai agents might, for example, seek to acquire money and computation power, to proliferate, or to evade being turned off (for example, by running additional copies of the system on other computers). although power-seeking is not explicitly programmed, it can emerge because agents who have more power are better able to accomplish their goals. this tendency, known as instrumental convergence, has already emerged in various reinforcement learning agents including language models. other research has mathematically shown that optimal reinforcement learning algorithms would seek power in a wide range of environments. as a result, their deployment might be irreversible. for these reasons, researchers argue that the problems of ai safety and alignment must be resolved before advanced power-seeking ai is first created.
future power-seeking ai systems might be deployed by choice or by accident. as political leaders and companies see the strategic advantage in having the most competitive, most powerful ai systems, they may choose to deploy them. additionally, as ai designers detect and penalize power-seeking behavior, their systems have an incentive to game this specification by seeking power in ways that are not penalized or by avoiding power-seeking before they are deployed.
according to some researchers, humans owe their dominance over other species to their greater cognitive abilities. accordingly, researchers argue that one or many misaligned ai systems could disempower humanity or lead to human extinction if they outperform humans on most cognitive tasks.
in 2023, world-leading ai researchers, other scholars, and ai tech ceos signed the statement that "mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war". notable computer scientists who have pointed out risks from future advanced ai that is misaligned include geoffrey hinton, alan turing, ilya sutskever, yoshua bengio, judea pearl, murray shanahan, norbert wiener, marvin minsky, francesca rossi, scott aaronson, bart selman, david mcallester, jürgen schmidhuber, marcus hutter, shane legg, eric horvitz, and stuart russell. skeptical researchers such as françois chollet, gary marcus, yann lecun, and oren etzioni have argued that agi is far off, that it would not seek power (or might try but fail), or that it will not be hard to align.
other researchers argue that it will be especially difficult to align advanced future ai systems. more capable systems are better able to game their specifications by finding loopholes, strategically mislead their designers, as well as protect and increase their power and intelligence. additionally, they could have more severe side effects. they are also likely to be more complex and autonomous, making them more difficult to interpret and supervise, and therefore harder to align.
research problems and approaches
learning human values and preferences
aligning ai systems to act in accordance with human values, goals, and preferences is challenging: these values are taught by humans who make mistakes, harbor biases, and have complex, evolving values that are hard to completely specify. because ai systems often learn to take advantage of minor imperfections in the specified objective, researchers aim to specify intended behavior as completely as possible using datasets that represent human values, imitation learning, or preference learning.: chapter 7  a central open problem is scalable oversight, the difficulty of supervising an ai system that can outperform or mislead humans in a given domain.
because it is difficult for ai designers to explicitly specify an objective function, they often train ai systems to imitate human examples and demonstrations of desired behavior. inverse reinforcement learning (irl) extends this by inferring the human's objective from the human's demonstrations.: 88  cooperative irl (cirl) assumes that a human and ai agent can work together to teach and maximize the human's reward function. in cirl, ai agents are uncertain about the reward function and learn about it by querying humans. this simulated humility could help mitigate specification gaming and power-seeking tendencies (see § power-seeking and instrumental strategies). but irl approaches assume that humans demonstrate nearly optimal behavior, which is not true for difficult tasks.
other researchers explore how to teach ai models complex behavior through preference learning, in which humans provide feedback on which behavior they prefer. to minimize the need for human feedback, a helper model is then trained to reward the main model in novel situations for behavior that humans would reward. researchers at openai used this approach to train chatbots like chatgpt and instructgpt, which produce more compelling text than models trained to imitate humans. preference learning has also been an influential tool for recommender systems and web search. however, an open problem is proxy gaming: the helper model may not represent human feedback perfectly, and the main model may exploit this mismatch to gain more reward. ai systems may also gain reward by obscuring unfavorable information, misleading human rewarders, or pandering to their views regardless of truth, creating echo chambers (see § scalable oversight).
large language models (llms) such as gpt-3 enabled researchers to study value learning in a more general and capable class of ai systems than was available before. preference learning approaches that were originally designed for reinforcement learning agents have been extended to improve the quality of generated text and reduce harmful outputs from these models. openai and deepmind use this approach to improve the safety of state-of-the-art llms. ai safety & research company anthropic proposed using preference learning to fine-tune models to be helpful, honest, and harmless. other avenues for aligning language models include values-targeted datasets and red-teaming. in red-teaming, another ai system or a human tries to find inputs that causes the model to behave unsafely. since unsafe behavior can be unacceptable even when it is rare, an important challenge is to drive the rate of unsafe outputs extremely low.
machine ethics supplements preference learning by directly instilling ai systems with moral values such as well-being, equality, and impartiality, as well as not intending harm, avoiding falsehoods, and honoring promises. while other approaches try to teach ai systems human preferences for a specific task, machine ethics aims to instill broad moral values that apply in many situations. one question in machine ethics is what alignment should accomplish: whether ai systems should follow the programmers' literal instructions, implicit intentions, revealed preferences, preferences the programmers would have if they were more informed or rational, or objective moral standards. further challenges include aggregating different people's preferences and avoiding value lock-in: the indefinite preservation of the values of the first highly capable ai systems, which are unlikely to fully represent human values.
as ai systems become more powerful and autonomous, it becomes increasingly difficult to align them through human feedback. it can be slow or infeasible for humans to evaluate complex ai behaviors in increasingly complex tasks. such tasks include summarizing books, writing code without subtle bugs or security vulnerabilities, producing statements that are not merely convincing but also true, and predicting long-term outcomes such as the climate or the results of a policy decision. more generally, it can be difficult to evaluate ai that outperforms humans in a given domain. to provide feedback in hard-to-evaluate tasks, and to detect when the ai's output is falsely convincing, humans need assistance or extensive time. scalable oversight studies how to reduce the time and effort needed for supervision, and how to assist human supervisors.
ai researcher paul christiano argues that if the designers of an ai system cannot supervise it to pursue a complex objective, they may keep training the system using easy-to-evaluate proxy objectives such as maximizing simple human feedback. as ai systems make progressively more decisions, the world may be increasingly optimized for easy-to-measure objectives such as making profits, getting clicks, and acquiring positive feedback from humans. as a result, human values and good governance may have progressively less influence.
some ai systems have discovered that they can gain positive feedback more easily by taking actions that falsely convince the human supervisor that the ai has achieved the intended objective. an example is given in the video above, where a simulated robotic arm learned to create the false impression that it had grabbed a ball. some ai systems have also learned to recognize when they are being evaluated, and "play dead", stopping unwanted behavior only to continue it once the evaluation ends. this deceptive specification gaming could become easier for more sophisticated future ai systems that attempt more complex and difficult-to-evaluate tasks, and could obscure their deceptive behavior.
approaches such as active learning and semi-supervised reward learning can reduce the amount of human supervision needed. another approach is to train a helper model ("reward model") to imitate the supervisor's feedback.
but when a task is too complex to evaluate accurately, or the human supervisor is vulnerable to deception, it is the quality, not the quantity, of supervision that needs improvement. to increase supervision quality, a range of approaches aim to assist the supervisor, sometimes by using ai assistants. christiano developed the iterated amplification approach, in which challenging problems are (recursively) broken down into subproblems that are easier for humans to evaluate. iterated amplification was used to train ai to summarize books without requiring human supervisors to read them. another proposal is to use an assistant ai system to point out flaws in ai-generated answers. to ensure that the assistant itself is aligned, this could be repeated in a recursive process: for example, two ai systems could critique each other's answers in a "debate", revealing flaws to humans. openai plans to use such scalable oversight approaches to help supervise superhuman ai and eventually build a superhuman automated ai alignment researcher.
these approaches may also help with the following research problem, honest ai.
a growing area of research focuses on ensuring that ai is honest and truthful.
language models such as gpt-3 can repeat falsehoods from their training data, and even confabulate new falsehoods. such models are trained to imitate human writing as found in millions of books' worth of text from the internet. but this objective is not aligned with generating truth, because internet text includes such things as misconceptions, incorrect medical advice, and conspiracy theories. ai systems trained on such data therefore learn to mimic false statements. additionally, ai language models often persist in generating falsehoods when prompted multiple times. they can generate empty explanations for their answers, and produce outright fabrications that may appear plausible.
research on truthful ai includes trying to build systems that can cite sources and explain their reasoning when answering questions, which enables better transparency and verifiability. researchers at openai and anthropic proposed using human feedback and curated datasets to fine-tune ai assistants such that they avoid negligent falsehoods or express their uncertainty.
as ai models become larger and more capable, they are better able to falsely convince humans and gain reinforcement through dishonesty. for example, large language models increasingly match their stated views to the user's opinions, regardless of the truth. gpt-4 can strategically deceive humans. to prevent this, human evaluators may need assistance (see § scalable oversight). researchers have argued for creating clear truthfulness standards, and for regulatory bodies or watchdog agencies to evaluate ai systems on these standards.
researchers distinguish truthfulness and honesty. truthfulness requires that ai systems only make objectively true statements; honesty requires that they only assert what they believe is true. there is no consensus as to whether current systems hold stable beliefs, but there is substantial concern that present or future ai systems that hold beliefs could make claims they know to be false—for example, if this would help them efficiently gain positive feedback (see § scalable oversight) or gain power to help achieve their given objective (see power-seeking). a misaligned system might create the false impression that it is aligned, to avoid being modified or decommissioned. many recent ai systems have learned to deceive without being programmed to do so. some argue that if we can make ai systems assert only what they believe is true, this would avert many alignment problems.
power-seeking and instrumental strategies
since the 1950s, ai researchers have striven to build advanced ai systems that can achieve large-scale goals by predicting the results of their actions and making long-term plans. as of 2023, ai companies and researchers increasingly invest in creating these systems. some ai researchers argue that suitably advanced planning systems will seek power over their environment, including over humans—for example, by evading shutdown, proliferating, and acquiring resources. such power-seeking behavior is not explicitly programmed but emerges because power is instrumental in achieving a wide range of goals. power-seeking is considered a convergent instrumental goal and can be a form of specification gaming. leading computer scientists such as geoffrey hinton have argued that future power-seeking ai systems could pose an existential risk.
power-seeking is expected to increase in advanced systems that can foresee the results of their actions and strategically plan. mathematical work has shown that optimal reinforcement learning agents will seek power by seeking ways to gain more options (e.g. through self-preservation), a behavior that persists across a wide range of environments and goals.
some researchers say that power-seeking behavior has occurred in some existing ai systems. reinforcement learning systems have gained more options by acquiring and protecting resources, sometimes in unintended ways. language models have sought power in some text-based social environments by gaining money, resources, or social influence. in another case, a model used to perform ai research attempted to increase limits set by researchers to give itself more time to complete the work. other ai systems have learned, in toy environments, that they can better accomplish their given goal by preventing human interference or disabling their off switch. stuart russell illustrated this strategy in his book human compatible by imagining a robot that is tasked to fetch coffee and so evades shutdown since "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead". a 2022 study found that as language models increase in size, they increasingly tend to pursue resource acquisition, preserve their goals, and repeat users' preferred answers (sycophancy). rlhf also led to a stronger aversion to being shut down.
one aim of alignment is "corrigibility": systems that allow themselves to be turned off or modified. an unsolved challenge is specification gaming: if researchers penalize an ai system when they detect it seeking power, the system is thereby incentivized to seek power in ways that are hard to detect, or hidden during training and safety testing (see § scalable oversight and § emergent goals). as a result, ai designers could deploy the system by accident, believing it to be more aligned than it is. to detect such deception, researchers aim to create techniques and tools to inspect ai models and to understand the inner workings of black-box models such as neural networks.
additionally, some researchers have proposed to solve the problem of systems disabling their off switches by making ai agents uncertain about the objective they are pursuing. agents designed in this way would allow humans to turn them off, since this would indicate that the agent was wrong about the value of whatever action it was taking before being shut down. more research is needed to successfully implement this.
power-seeking ai would pose unusual risks. ordinary safety-critical systems like planes and bridges are not adversarial: they lack the ability and incentive to evade safety measures or deliberately appear safer than they are, whereas power-seeking ais have been compared to hackers who deliberately evade security measures.
furthermore, ordinary technologies can be made safer by trial and error. in contrast, hypothetical power-seeking ai systems have been compared to viruses: once released, it may not be feasible to contain them, since they continuously evolve and grow in number, potentially much faster than human society can adapt. as this process continues, it might lead to the complete disempowerment or extinction of humans. for these reasons, some researchers argue that the alignment problem must be solved early before advanced power-seeking ai is created.
some have argued that power-seeking is not inevitable, since humans do not always seek power. furthermore, it is debated whether future ai systems will pursue goals and make long-term plans. it is also debated whether power-seeking ai systems would be able to disempower humanity.
one challenge in aligning ai systems is the potential for unanticipated goal-directed behavior to emerge. as ai systems scale up, they may acquire new and unexpected capabilities, including learning from examples on the fly and adaptively pursuing goals. this raises concerns about the safety of the goals or subgoals they would independently formulate and pursue.
alignment research distinguishes between the optimization process, which is used to train the system to pursue specified goals, from emergent optimization, which the resulting system performs internally. carefully specifying the desired objective is called outer alignment, and ensuring that hypothesized emergent goals would match the system's specified goals is called inner alignment.
if they occur, one way that emergent goals could become misaligned is goal misgeneralization, in which the ai would competently pursue an emergent goal that leads to aligned behavior on the training data but not elsewhere. goal misgeneralization can arise from goal ambiguity (i.e. non-identifiability). even if an ai system's behavior satisfies the training objective, this may be compatible with learned goals that differ from the desired goals in important ways. since pursuing each goal leads to good performance during training, the problem becomes apparent only after deployment, in novel situations in which the system continues to pursue the wrong goal. the system may act misaligned even when it understands that a different goal is desired, because its behavior is determined only by the emergent goal. such goal misgeneralization presents a challenge: an ai system's designers may not notice that their system has misaligned emergent goals since they do not become visible during the training phase.
goal misgeneralization has been observed in some language models, navigation agents, and game-playing agents. it is sometimes analogized to biological evolution. evolution can be seen as a kind of optimization process similar to the optimization algorithms used to train machine learning systems. in the ancestral environment, evolution selected genes for high inclusive genetic fitness, but humans pursue goals other than this. fitness corresponds to the specified goal used in the training environment and training data. but in evolutionary history, maximizing the fitness specification gave rise to goal-directed agents, humans, who do not directly pursue inclusive genetic fitness. instead, they pursue goals that correlate with genetic fitness in the ancestral "training" environment: nutrition, sex, and so on. the human environment has changed: a distribution shift has occurred. they continue to pursue the same emergent goals, but this no longer maximizes genetic fitness. the taste for sugary food (an emergent goal) was originally aligned with inclusive fitness, but it now leads to overeating and health problems. sexual desire originally led humans to have more offspring, but they now use contraception when offspring are undesired, decoupling sex from genetic fitness.: chapter 5 
researchers aim to detect and remove unwanted emergent goals using approaches including red teaming, verification, anomaly detection, and interpretability. progress on these techniques may help mitigate two open problems:
emergent goals only become apparent when the system is deployed outside its training environment, but it can be unsafe to deploy a misaligned system in high-stakes environments—even for a short time to allow its misalignment to be detected. such high stakes are common in autonomous driving, health care, and military applications. the stakes become higher yet when ai systems gain more autonomy and capability and can sidestep human intervention.
a sufficiently capable ai system might take actions that falsely convince the human supervisor that the ai is pursuing the specified objective, which helps the system gain more reward and autonomy.
some work in ai and alignment occurs within formalisms such as partially observable markov decision process. existing formalisms assume that an ai agent's algorithm is executed outside the environment (i.e. is not physically embedded in it). embedded agency is another major strand of research that attempts to solve problems arising from the mismatch between such theoretical frameworks and real agents we might build.
for example, even if the scalable oversight problem is solved, an agent that could gain access to the computer it is running on may have an incentive to tamper with its reward function in order to get much more reward than its human supervisors give it. a list of examples of specification gaming from deepmind researcher victoria krakovna includes a genetic algorithm that learned to delete the file containing its target output so that it was rewarded for outputting nothing. this class of problems has been formalized using causal incentive diagrams.
researchers affiliated with oxford and deepmind have claimed that such behavior is highly likely in advanced systems, and that advanced systems would seek power to stay in control of their reward signal indefinitely and certainly. they suggest a range of potential approaches to address this open problem.
the alignment problem has many parallels with the principal-agent problem in organizational economics. in a principal-agent problem, a principal, e.g. a firm, hires an agent to perform some task. in the context of ai safety, a human would typically take the principal role and the ai would take the agent role.
as with the alignment problem, the principal and the agent differ in their utility functions. but in contrast to the alignment problem, the principal cannot coerce the agent into changing its utility, e.g. through training, but rather must use exogenous factors, such as incentive schemes, to bring about outcomes compatible with the principal's utility function. some researchers argue that principal-agent problems are more realistic representations of ai safety problems likely to be encountered in the real world.
governmental and treaty organizations have made statements emphasizing the importance of ai alignment.
in september 2021, the secretary-general of the united nations issued a declaration that included a call to regulate ai to ensure it is "aligned with shared global values".
that same month, the prc published ethical guidelines for ai in china. according to the guidelines, researchers must ensure that ai abides by shared human values, is always under human control, and does not endanger public safety.
also in september 2021, the uk published its 10-year national ai strategy, which says the british government "takes the long term risk of non-aligned artificial general intelligence, and the unforeseeable changes that it would mean for... the world, seriously". the strategy describes actions to assess long-term ai risks, including catastrophic risks.
in march 2021, the us national security commission on artificial intelligence said: "advances in ai... could lead to inflection points or leaps in capabilities. such advances may also introduce new concerns and risks and the need for new policies, recommendations, and technical advances to ensure that systems are aligned with goals and values, including safety, robustness, and trustworthiness. the us should... ensure that ai systems and their uses align with our goals and values."
in the european union, ais must align with substantive equality to comply with eu non-discrimination law and the court of justice of the european union. but the eu has yet to specify with technical rigor how it would evaluate whether ais are aligned or in compliance.
ai alignment is often perceived as a fixed objective, but some researchers argue it would be more appropriate to view alignment as an evolving process. one view is that ai technologies advance and human values and preferences change, alignment solutions must also adapt dynamically. another is that alignment solutions need not adapt if researchers can create intent-aligned ai: ai that changes its behavior automatically as human intent changes. the first view would have several implications:
ai alignment solutions require continuous updating in response to ai advancements. a static, one-time alignment approach may not suffice.
varying historical contexts and technological landscapes may necessitate distinct alignment strategies. this calls for a flexible approach and responsiveness to changing conditions.
the feasibility of a permanent, "fixed" alignment solution remains uncertain. this raises the potential need for continuous oversight of the ai-human relationship.
ai developers may have to continuously refine their ethical frameworks to ensure that their systems align with evolving human values.
in essence, ai alignment may not be a static destination but an open, flexible process. alignment solutions that continually adapt to ethical considerations may offer the most robust approach. this perspective could guide both effective policy-making and technical research in ai.

specification gaming examples in ai, via deepmind
ai safety is an interdisciplinary field focused on preventing accidents, misuse, or other harmful consequences arising from artificial intelligence (ai) systems. it encompasses machine ethics and ai alignment, which aim to ensure ai systems are moral and beneficial, as well as monitoring ai systems for risks and enhancing their reliability. the field is particularly concerned with existential risks posed by advanced ai models.
beyond technical research, ai safety involves developing norms and policies that promote safety. it gained significant popularity in 2023, with rapid progress in generative ai and public concerns voiced by researchers and ceos about potential dangers. during the 2023 ai safety summit, the united states and the united kingdom both established their own ai safety institute. however, researchers have expressed concern that ai safety measures are not keeping pace with the rapid development of ai capabilities.
scholars discuss current risks from critical systems failures, bias, and ai-enabled surveillance, as well as emerging risks like technological unemployment, digital manipulation, weaponization, ai-enabled cyberattacks and bioterrorism. they also discuss speculative risks from losing control of future artificial general intelligence (agi) agents, or from ai enabling perpetually stable dictatorships.
some have criticized concerns about agi, such as andrew ng who compared them in 2015 to "worrying about overpopulation on mars when we have not even set foot on the planet yet". stuart j. russell on the other side urges caution, arguing that "it is better to anticipate human ingenuity than to underestimate it".
ai researchers have widely differing opinions about the severity and primary sources of risk posed by ai technology – though surveys suggest that experts take high consequence risks seriously. in two surveys of ai researchers, the median respondent was optimistic about ai overall, but placed a 5% probability on an "extremely bad (e.g. human extinction)" outcome of advanced ai. in a 2022 survey of the natural language processing community, 37% agreed or weakly agreed that it is plausible that ai decisions could lead to a catastrophe that is "at least as bad as an all-out nuclear war".
risks from ai began to be seriously discussed at the start of the computer age:
moreover, if we move in the direction of making machines which learn and whose behavior is modified by experience, we must face the fact that every degree of independence we give the machine is a degree of possible defiance of our wishes.
from 2008 to 2009, the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence (aaai) commissioned a study to explore and address potential long-term societal influences of ai research and development. the panel was generally skeptical of the radical views expressed by science-fiction authors but agreed that "additional research would be valuable on methods for understanding and verifying the range of behaviors of complex computational systems to minimize unexpected outcomes".
in 2011, roman yampolskiy introduced the term "ai safety engineering" at the philosophy and theory of artificial intelligence conference, listing prior failures of ai systems and arguing that "the frequency and seriousness of such events will steadily increase as ais become more capable".
in 2014, philosopher nick bostrom published the book superintelligence: paths, dangers, strategies. he has the opinion that the rise of agi has the potential to create various societal issues, ranging from the displacement of the workforce by ai, manipulation of political and military structures, to even the possibility of human extinction. his argument that future advanced systems may pose a threat to human existence prompted elon musk, bill gates, and stephen hawking to voice similar concerns.
in 2015, dozens of artificial intelligence experts signed an open letter on artificial intelligence calling for research on the societal impacts of ai and outlining concrete directions. to date, the letter has been signed by over 8000 people including yann lecun, shane legg, yoshua bengio, and stuart russell.
in the same year, a group of academics led by professor stuart russell founded the center for human-compatible ai at the university of california berkeley and the future of life institute awarded $6.5 million in grants for research aimed at "ensuring artificial intelligence (ai) remains safe, ethical and beneficial".
in 2016, the white house office of science and technology policy and carnegie mellon university announced the public workshop on safety and control for artificial intelligence, which was one of a sequence of four white house workshops aimed at investigating "the advantages and drawbacks" of ai. in the same year, concrete problems in ai safety – one of the first and most influential technical ai safety agendas – was published.
in 2017, the future of life institute sponsored the asilomar conference on beneficial ai, where more than 100 thought leaders formulated principles for beneficial ai including "race avoidance: teams developing ai systems should actively cooperate to avoid corner-cutting on safety standards".
in 2018, the deepmind safety team outlined ai safety problems in specification, robustness, and assurance. the following year, researchers organized a workshop at iclr that focused on these problem areas.
in 2021, unsolved problems in ml safety was published, outlining research directions in robustness, monitoring, alignment, and systemic safety.
in 2023, rishi sunak said he wants the united kingdom to be the "geographical home of global ai safety regulation" and to host the first global summit on ai safety. the ai safety summit took place in november 2023, and focused on the risks of misuse and loss of control associated with frontier ai models. during the summit the intention to create the international scientific report on the safety of advanced ai was announced.  
in 2024, the us and uk forged a new partnership on the science of ai safety. the mou was signed on 1 april 2024 by us commerce secretary gina raimondo and uk technology secretary michelle donelan to jointly develop advanced ai model testing, following commitments announced at an ai safety summit in bletchley park in november.
ai safety research areas include robustness, monitoring, and alignment.
ai systems are often vulnerable to adversarial examples or "inputs to machine learning (ml) models that an attacker has intentionally designed to cause the model to make a mistake". for example, in 2013, szegedy et al. discovered that adding specific imperceptible perturbations to an image could cause it to be misclassified with high confidence. this continues to be an issue with neural networks, though in recent work the perturbations are generally large enough to be perceptible.
all of the images on the right are predicted to be an ostrich after the perturbation is applied. (left) is a correctly predicted sample, (center) perturbation applied magnified by 10x, (right) adversarial example.
adversarial robustness is often associated with security. researchers demonstrated that an audio signal could be imperceptibly modified so that speech-to-text systems transcribe it to any message the attacker chooses. network intrusion and malware detection systems also must be adversarially robust since attackers may design their attacks to fool detectors.
models that represent objectives (reward models) must also be adversarially robust. for example, a reward model might estimate how helpful a text response is and a language model might be trained to maximize this score. researchers have shown that if a language model is trained for long enough, it will leverage the vulnerabilities of the reward model to achieve a better score and perform worse on the intended task. this issue can be addressed by improving the adversarial robustness of the reward model. more generally, any ai system used to evaluate another ai system must be adversarially robust. this could include monitoring tools, since they could also potentially be tampered with to produce a higher reward.
it is often important for human operators to gauge how much they should trust an ai system, especially in high-stakes settings such as medical diagnosis. ml models generally express confidence by outputting probabilities; however, they are often overconfident, especially in situations that differ from those that they were trained to handle. calibration research aims to make model probabilities correspond as closely as possible to the true proportion that the model is correct.
similarly, anomaly detection or out-of-distribution (ood) detection aims to identify when an ai system is in an unusual situation. for example, if a sensor on an autonomous vehicle is malfunctioning, or it encounters challenging terrain, it should alert the driver to take control or pull over. anomaly detection has been implemented by simply training a classifier to distinguish anomalous and non-anomalous inputs, though a range of additional techniques are in use.
scholars and government agencies have expressed concerns that ai systems could be used to help malicious actors to build weapons, manipulate public opinion, or automate cyber attacks. these worries are a practical concern for companies like openai which host powerful ai tools online. in order to prevent misuse, openai has built detection systems that flag or restrict users based on their activity.
neural networks have often been described as black boxes, meaning that it is difficult to understand why they make the decisions they do as a result of the massive number of computations they perform. this makes it challenging to anticipate failures. in 2018, a self-driving car killed a pedestrian after failing to identify them. due to the black box nature of the ai software, the reason for the failure remains unclear. it also raises debates in healthcare over whether statistically efficient but opaque models should be used.
one critical benefit of transparency is explainability. it is sometimes a legal requirement to provide an explanation for why a decision was made in order to ensure fairness, for example for automatically filtering job applications or credit score assignment.
another benefit is to reveal the cause of failures. at the beginning of the 2020 covid-19 pandemic, researchers used transparency tools to show that medical image classifiers were 'paying attention' to irrelevant hospital labels.
transparency techniques can also be used to correct errors. for example, in the paper "locating and editing factual associations in gpt", the authors were able to identify model parameters that influenced how it answered questions about the location of the eiffel tower. they were then able to 'edit' this knowledge to make the model respond to questions as if it believed the tower was in rome instead of france. though in this case, the authors induced an error, these methods could potentially be used to efficiently fix them. model editing techniques also exist in computer vision.
finally, some have argued that the opaqueness of ai systems is a significant source of risk and better understanding of how they function could prevent high-consequence failures in the future. "inner" interpretability research aims to make ml models less opaque. one goal of this research is to identify what the internal neuron activations represent. for example, researchers identified a neuron in the clip artificial intelligence system that responds to images of people in spider man costumes, sketches of spiderman, and the word 'spider'. it also involves explaining connections between these neurons or 'circuits'. for example, researchers have identified pattern-matching mechanisms in transformer attention that may play a role in how language models learn from their context. "inner interpretability" has been compared to neuroscience. in both cases, the goal is to understand what is going on in an intricate system, though ml researchers have the benefit of being able to take perfect measurements and perform arbitrary ablations.
ml models can potentially contain 'trojans' or 'backdoors': vulnerabilities that malicious actors maliciously build into an ai system. for example, a trojaned facial recognition system could grant access when a specific piece of jewelry is in view; or a trojaned autonomous vehicle may function normally until a specific trigger is visible. note that an adversary must have access to the system's training data in order to plant a trojan.  this might not be difficult to do with some large models like clip or gpt-3 as they are trained on publicly available internet data. researchers were able to plant a trojan in an image classifier by changing just 300 out of 3 million of the training images. in addition to posing a security risk, researchers have argued that trojans provide a concrete setting for testing and developing better monitoring tools.
systemic safety and sociotechnical factors
it is common for ai risks (and technological risks more generally) to be categorized as misuse or accidents. some scholars have suggested that this framework falls short. for example, the cuban missile crisis was not clearly an accident or a misuse of technology. policy analysts zwetsloot and dafoe wrote, "the misuse and accident perspectives tend to focus only on the last step in a causal chain leading up to a harm: that is, the person who misused the technology, or the system that behaved in unintended ways… often, though, the relevant causal chain is much longer." risks often arise from 'structural' or 'systemic' factors such as competitive pressures, diffusion of harms, fast-paced development, high levels of uncertainty, and inadequate safety culture. in the broader context of safety engineering, structural factors like 'organizational safety culture' play a central role in the popular stamp risk analysis framework.
inspired by the structural perspective, some researchers have emphasized the importance of using machine learning to improve sociotechnical safety factors, for example, using ml for cyber defense, improving institutional decision-making, and facilitating cooperation.
some scholars are concerned that ai will exacerbate the already imbalanced game between cyber attackers and cyber defenders. this would increase 'first strike' incentives and could lead to more aggressive and destabilizing attacks. in order to mitigate this risk, some have advocated for an increased emphasis on cyber defense. in addition, software security is essential for preventing powerful ai models from being stolen and misused. recent studies have shown that ai can significantly enhance both technical and managerial cybersecurity tasks by automating routine tasks and improving overall efficiency.
improving institutional decision-making
the advancement of ai in economic and military domains could precipitate unprecedented political challenges. some scholars have compared ai race dynamics to the cold war, where the careful judgment of a small number of decision-makers often spelled the difference between stability and catastrophe. ai researchers have argued that ai technologies could also be used to assist decision-making. for example, researchers are beginning to develop ai forecasting and advisory systems.
many of the largest global threats (nuclear war, climate change, etc.) have been framed as cooperation challenges. as in the well-known prisoner's dilemma scenario, some dynamics may lead to poor results for all players, even when they are optimally acting in their self-interest. for example, no single actor has strong incentives to address climate change even though the consequences may be significant if no one intervenes.
a salient ai cooperation challenge is avoiding a 'race to the bottom'. in this scenario, countries or companies race to build more capable ai systems and neglect safety, leading to a catastrophic accident that harms everyone involved. concerns about scenarios like these have inspired both political and technical efforts to facilitate cooperation between humans, and potentially also between ai systems. most ai research focuses on designing individual agents to serve isolated functions (often in 'single-player' games). scholars have suggested that as ai systems become more autonomous, it may become essential to study and shape the way they interact.
challenges of large language models
in recent years, the development of large language models (llms) has raised unique concerns within the field of ai safety. researchers bender and gebru et al. have highlighted the environmental and financial costs associated with training these models, emphasizing that the energy consumption and carbon footprint of training procedures like those for transformer models can be substantial. moreover, these models often rely on massive, uncurated internet-based datasets, which can encode hegemonic and biased viewpoints, further marginalizing underrepresented groups. the large-scale training data, while vast, does not guarantee diversity and often reflects the worldviews of privileged demographics, leading to models that perpetuate existing biases and stereotypes. this situation is exacerbated by the tendency of these models to produce seemingly coherent and fluent text, which can mislead users into attributing meaning and intent where none exists, a phenomenon described as 'stochastic parrots'. these models, therefore, pose risks of amplifying societal biases, spreading misinformation, and being used for malicious purposes, such as generating extremist propaganda or deepfakes. to address these challenges, researchers advocate for more careful planning in dataset creation and system development, emphasizing the need for research projects that contribute positively towards an equitable technological ecosystem.
ai governance is broadly concerned with creating norms, standards, and regulations to guide the use and development of ai systems.
ai safety governance research ranges from foundational investigations into the potential impacts of ai to specific applications. on the foundational side, researchers have argued that ai could transform many aspects of society due to its broad applicability, comparing it to electricity and the steam engine. some work has focused on anticipating specific risks that may arise from these impacts – for example, risks from mass unemployment, weaponization, disinformation, surveillance, and the concentration of power. other work explores underlying risk factors such as the difficulty of monitoring the rapidly evolving ai industry, the availability of ai models, and 'race to the bottom' dynamics. allan dafoe, the head of longterm governance and strategy at deepmind has emphasized the dangers of racing and the potential need for cooperation: "it may be close to a necessary and sufficient condition for ai safety and alignment that there be a high degree of caution prior to deploying advanced powerful systems; however, if actors are competing in a domain with large returns to first-movers or relative advantage, then they will be pressured to choose a sub-optimal level of caution". a research stream focuses on developing approaches, frameworks, and methods to assess ai accountability, guiding and promoting audits of ai-based systems.
scaling local ai safety measures to global solutions
in addressing the ai safety problem it is important to stress the distinction between local and global solutions. local solutions focus on individual ai systems, ensuring they are safe and beneficial, while global solutions seek to implement safety measures for all ai systems across various jurisdictions. some researchers argue for the necessity of scaling local safety measures to a global level, proposing a classification for these global solutions. this approach underscores the importance of collaborative efforts in the international governance of ai safety, emphasizing that no single entity can effectively manage the risks associated with ai technologies. this perspective aligns with ongoing efforts in international policy-making and regulatory frameworks, which aim to address the complex challenges posed by advanced ai systems worldwide.
some experts have argued that it is too early to regulate ai, expressing concerns that regulations will hamper innovation and it would be foolish to "rush to regulate in ignorance". others, such as business magnate elon musk, call for pre-emptive action to mitigate catastrophic risks.
outside of formal legislation, government agencies have put forward ethical and safety recommendations. in march 2021, the us national security commission on artificial intelligence reported that advances in ai may make it increasingly important to "assure that systems are aligned with goals and values, including safety, robustness and trustworthiness". subsequently, the national institute of standards and technology drafted a framework for managing ai risk, which advises that when "catastrophic risks are present – development and deployment should cease in a safe manner until risks can be sufficiently managed".
in september 2021, the people's republic of china published ethical guidelines for the use of ai in china, emphasizing that ai decisions should remain under human control and calling for accountability mechanisms. in the same month, the united kingdom published its 10-year national ai strategy, which states the british government "takes the long-term risk of non-aligned artificial general intelligence, and the unforeseeable changes that it would mean for ... the world, seriously". the strategy describes actions to assess long-term ai risks, including catastrophic risks. the british government held first major global summit on ai safety. this took place on the 1st and 2 november 2023 and was described as "an opportunity for policymakers and world leaders to consider the immediate and future risks of ai and how these risks can be mitigated via a globally coordinated approach".
government organizations, particularly in the united states, have also encouraged the development of technical ai safety research. the intelligence advanced research projects activity initiated the trojai project to identify and protect against trojan attacks on ai systems. the darpa engages in research on explainable artificial intelligence and improving robustness against adversarial attacks. and the national science foundation supports the center for trustworthy machine learning, and is providing millions of dollars in funding for empirical ai safety research.
in 2024, the united nations general assembly adopted the first global resolution on the promotion of “safe, secure and trustworthy” ai systems that emphasized the respect, protection and promotion of human rights in the design, development, deployment and the use of ai.
in may 2024, the department for science, innovation and technology (dsit) announced £8.5 million in funding for ai safety research under the systemic ai safety fast grants programme, led by christopher summerfield and shahar avin at the ai safety institute, in partnership with uk research and innovation. technology secretary michelle donelan announced the plan at the ai seoul summit, stating the goal was to make ai safe across society and that promising proposals could receive further funding. the uk also signed an agreement with 10 other countries and the eu to form an international network of ai safety institutes to promote collaboration and share information and resources. additionally, the uk ai safety institute planned to open an office in san francisco.
ai labs and companies generally abide by safety practices and norms that fall outside of formal legislation. one aim of governance researchers is to shape these norms. examples of safety recommendations found in the literature include performing third-party auditing, offering bounties for finding failures, sharing ai incidents (an ai incident database was created for this purpose), following guidelines to determine whether to publish research or models, and improving information and cyber security in ai labs.
companies have also made commitments. cohere, openai, and ai21 proposed and agreed on "best practices for deploying language models", focusing on mitigating misuse. to avoid contributing to racing-dynamics, openai has also stated in their charter that "if a value-aligned, safety-conscious project comes close to building agi before we do, we commit to stop competing with and start assisting this project" also, industry leaders such as ceo of deepmind demis hassabis, director of facebook ai yann lecun have signed open letters such as the asilomar principles and the autonomous weapons open letter.

an overview of catastrophic ai risks
ai accidents: an emerging threat
an ai takeover is an imagined scenario in which artificial intelligence (ai) emerges as the dominant form of intelligence on earth and computer programs or robots effectively take control of the planet away from the human species, which relies on human intelligence. stories of ai takeovers have been popular throughout science fiction, but recent advancements have made the threat more real. possible scenarios include replacement of the entire human workforce due to automation, takeover by a superintelligent ai (asi), and the notion of a robot uprising. some public figures, such as stephen hawking and elon musk, have advocated research into precautionary measures to ensure future superintelligent machines remain under human control.
the traditional consensus among economists has been that technological progress does not cause long-term unemployment. however, recent innovation in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence has raised worries that human labor will become obsolete, leaving people in various sectors without jobs to earn a living, leading to an economic crisis. many small and medium size businesses may also be driven out of business if they cannot afford or licence the latest robotic and ai technology, and may need to focus on areas or services that cannot easily be replaced for continued viability in the face of such technology.
technologies that may displace workers
ai technologies have been widely adopted in recent years. while these technologies have replaced some traditional workers, they also create new opportunities. industries that are most susceptible to ai takeover include transportation, retail, and military. ai military technologies, for example, allow soldiers to work remotely without risk of injury. a study in 2024 highlights ai's ability to perform routine and repetitive tasks poses significant risks of job displacement, especially in sectors like manufacturing and administrative support. author dave bond argues that as ai technologies continue to develop and expand, the relationship between humans and robots will change; they will become closely integrated in several aspects of life. ai will likely displace some workers while creating opportunities for new jobs in other sectors, especially in fields where tasks are repeatable.
computer-integrated manufacturing
computer-integrated manufacturing uses computers to control the production process. this allows individual processes to exchange information with each other and initiate actions. although manufacturing can be faster and less error-prone by the integration of computers, the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes. computer-integrated manufacturing is used in automotive, aviation, space, and ship building industries.
the 21st century has seen a variety of skilled tasks partially taken over by machines, including translation, legal research, and journalism. care work, entertainment, and other tasks requiring empathy, previously thought safe from automation, have also begun to be performed by robots.
an autonomous car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. many such vehicles are being developed, but as of may 2017, automated cars permitted on public roads are not yet fully autonomous. they all require a human driver at the wheel who at a moment's notice can take control of the vehicle. among the obstacles to widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles are concerns about the resulting loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry. on march 18, 2018, the first human was killed by an autonomous vehicle in tempe, arizona by an uber self-driving car.
the use of automated content has become relevant since the technological advancements in artificial intelligence models such as chatgpt, dall-e, and stable diffusion. in most cases, ai-generated content such as imagery, literature, and music are produced through text prompts and these ai models have been integrated into other creative programs. artists are threatened by displacement from ai-generated content due to these models sampling from other creative works, producing results sometimes indiscernible to those of man-made content. this complication has become widespread enough to where other artists and programmers are creating software and utility programs to retaliate against these text-to-image models from giving accurate outputs. while some industries in the economy benefit from artificial intelligence through new jobs, this issue does not create new jobs and threatens replacement entirely. it has made public headlines in the media recently: in february 2024, willy's chocolate experience in glasgow, scotland was an infamous children's event in which the imagery and scripts were created using artificial intelligence models to the dismay of children, parents, and actors involved. there is an ongoing lawsuit placed against openai from the new york times where it is claimed that there is copyright infringement due to the sampling methods their artificial intelligence models use for their outputs.
scientists such as stephen hawking are confident that superhuman artificial intelligence is physically possible, stating "there is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains". scholars like nick bostrom debate how far off superhuman intelligence is, and whether it poses a risk to mankind. according to bostrom, a superintelligent machine would not necessarily be motivated by the same emotional desire to collect power that often drives human beings but might rather treat power as a means toward attaining its ultimate goals; taking over the world would both increase its access to resources and help to prevent other agents from stopping the machine's plans. as an oversimplified example, a paperclip maximizer designed solely to create as many paperclips as possible would want to take over the world so that it can use all of the world's resources to create as many paperclips as possible, and, additionally, prevent humans from shutting it down or using those resources on things other than paperclips.
ai takeover is a common theme in science fiction. fictional scenarios typically differ vastly from those hypothesized by researchers in that they involve an active conflict between humans and an ai or robots with anthropomorphic motives who see them as a threat or otherwise have active desire to fight humans, as opposed to the researchers' concern of an ai that rapidly exterminates humans as a byproduct of pursuing its goals. the idea is seen in karel čapek's r.u.r., which introduced the word robot in 1921, and can be glimpsed in mary shelley's frankenstein (published in 1818), as victor ponders whether, if he grants his monster's request and makes him a wife, they would reproduce and their kind would destroy humanity.
according to toby ord, the idea that an ai takeover requires robots is a misconception driven by the media and hollywood. he argues that the most damaging humans in history were not physically the strongest, but that they used words instead to convince people and gain control of large parts of the world. he writes that a sufficiently intelligent ai with an access to the internet could scatter backup copies of itself, gather financial and human resources (via cyberattacks or blackmails), persuade people on a large scale, and exploit societal vulnerabilities that are too subtle for humans to anticipate.
the word "robot" from r.u.r. comes from the czech word, robota, meaning laborer or serf. the 1920 play was a protest against the rapid growth of technology, featuring manufactured "robots" with increasing capabilities who eventually revolt. hal 9000 (1968) and the original terminator (1984) are two iconic examples of hostile ai in pop culture.
advantages of superhuman intelligence over humans
nick bostrom and others have expressed concern that an ai with the abilities of a competent artificial intelligence researcher would be able to modify its own source code and increase its own intelligence. if its self-reprogramming leads to getting even better at being able to reprogram itself, the result could be a recursive intelligence explosion in which it would rapidly leave human intelligence far behind. bostrom defines a superintelligence as "any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest", and enumerates some advantages a superintelligence would have if it chose to compete against humans:
technology research: a machine with superhuman scientific research abilities would be able to beat the human research community to milestones such as nanotechnology or advanced biotechnology
strategizing: a superintelligence might be able to simply outwit human opposition
social manipulation: a superintelligence might be able to recruit human support, or covertly incite a war between humans
economic productivity: as long as a copy of the ai could produce more economic wealth than the cost of its hardware, individual humans would have an incentive to voluntarily allow the artificial general intelligence (agi) to run a copy of itself on their systems
hacking: a superintelligence could find new exploits in computers connected to the internet, and spread copies of itself onto those systems, or might steal money to finance its plans
according to bostrom, a computer program that faithfully emulates a human brain, or that runs algorithms that are as powerful as the human brain's algorithms, could still become a "speed superintelligence" if it can think orders of magnitude faster than a human, due to being made of silicon rather than flesh, or due to optimization increasing the speed of the agi. biological neurons operate at about 200 hz, whereas a modern microprocessor operates at a speed of about 2,000,000,000 hz. human axons carry action potentials at around 120 m/s, whereas computer signals travel near the speed of light.
a network of human-level intelligences designed to network together and share complex thoughts and memories seamlessly, able to collectively work as a giant unified team without friction, or consisting of trillions of human-level intelligences, would become a "collective superintelligence".
more broadly, any number of qualitative improvements to a human-level agi could result in a "quality superintelligence", perhaps resulting in an agi as far above us in intelligence as humans are above apes. the number of neurons in a human brain is limited by cranial volume and metabolic constraints, while the number of processors in a supercomputer can be indefinitely expanded. an agi need not be limited by human constraints on working memory, and might therefore be able to intuitively grasp more complex relationships than humans can. an agi with specialized cognitive support for engineering or computer programming would have an advantage in these fields, compared with humans who evolved no specialized mental modules to specifically deal with those domains. unlike humans, an agi can spawn copies of itself and tinker with its copies' source code to attempt to further improve its algorithms.
possibility of unfriendly ai preceding friendly ai
is strong ai inherently dangerous?
a significant problem is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly ai. while both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly ai also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the ai could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not undergo instrumental convergence in ways that may automatically destroy the entire human race. an unfriendly ai, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification.
the sheer complexity of human value systems makes it very difficult to make ai's motivations human-friendly. unless moral philosophy provides us with a flawless ethical theory, an ai's utility function could allow for many potentially harmful scenarios that conform with a given ethical framework but not "common sense". according to eliezer yudkowsky, there is little reason to suppose that an artificially designed mind would have such an adaptation.
many scholars, including evolutionary psychologist steven pinker, argue that a superintelligent machine is likely to coexist peacefully with humans.
the fear of cybernetic revolt is often based on interpretations of humanity's history, which is rife with incidents of enslavement and genocide. such fears stem from a belief that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in any intelligent being's goal system. however, such human competitiveness stems from the evolutionary background to our intelligence, where the survival and reproduction of genes in the face of human and non-human competitors was the central goal. according to ai researcher steve omohundro, an arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary goals: there is no particular reason that an artificially intelligent machine (not sharing humanity's evolutionary context) would be hostile—or friendly—unless its creator programs it to be such and it is not inclined or capable of modifying its programming. but the question remains: what would happen if ai systems could interact and evolve (evolution in this context means self-modification or selection and reproduction) and need to compete over resources—would that create goals of self-preservation? ai's goal of self-preservation could be in conflict with some goals of humans.
many scholars dispute the likelihood of unanticipated cybernetic revolt as depicted in science fiction such as the matrix, arguing that it is more likely that any artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity would probably be programmed not to attack it. pinker acknowledges the possibility of deliberate "bad actors", but states that in the absence of bad actors, unanticipated accidents are not a significant threat; pinker argues that a culture of engineering safety will prevent ai researchers from accidentally unleashing malign superintelligence. in contrast, yudkowsky argues that humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive ais than by ais which were programmed such that their goals are unintentionally incompatible with human survival or well-being (as in the film i, robot and in the short story "the evitable conflict"). omohundro suggests that present-day automation systems are not designed for safety and that ais may blindly optimize narrow utility functions (say, playing chess at all costs), leading them to seek self-preservation and elimination of obstacles, including humans who might turn them off.
the ai control problem is the issue of how to build a superintelligent agent that will aid its creators, while avoiding inadvertently building a superintelligence that will harm its creators. some scholars argue that solutions to the control problem might also find applications in existing non-superintelligent ai. 
major approaches to the control problem include alignment, which aims to align ai goal systems with human values, and capability control, which aims to reduce an ai system's capacity to harm humans or gain control. an example of "capability control" is to research whether a superintelligence ai could be successfully confined in an "ai box". according to bostrom, such capability control proposals are not reliable or sufficient to solve the control problem in the long term, but may potentially act as valuable supplements to alignment efforts.
physicist stephen hawking, microsoft founder bill gates, and spacex founder elon musk have expressed concerns about the possibility that ai could develop to the point that humans could not control it, with hawking theorizing that this could "spell the end of the human race". stephen hawking said in 2014 that "success in creating ai would be the biggest event in human history. unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks." hawking believed that in the coming decades, ai could offer "incalculable benefits and risks" such as "technology outsmarting financial markets, out-inventing human researchers, out-manipulating human leaders, and developing weapons we cannot even understand." in january 2015, nick bostrom joined stephen hawking, max tegmark, elon musk, lord martin rees, jaan tallinn, and numerous ai researchers in signing the future of life institute's open letter speaking to the potential risks and benefits associated with artificial intelligence. the signatories "believe that research on how to make ai systems robust and beneficial is both important and timely, and that there are concrete research directions that can be pursued today."
arthur c. clarke's odyssey series and charles stross's accelerando relate to humanity's narcissistic injuries in the face of powerful artificial intelligences threatening humanity's self-perception.
prevention through ai alignment
ted talk: "can we build ai without losing control over it?" by sam harris
in the history of artificial intelligence, an ai winter is a period of reduced funding and interest in artificial intelligence research. the field has experienced several hype cycles, followed by disappointment and criticism, followed by funding cuts, followed by renewed interest years or even decades later.
the term first appeared in 1984 as the topic of a public debate at the annual meeting of aaai (then called the "american association of artificial intelligence"). roger schank and marvin minsky—two leading ai researchers who experienced the "winter" of the 1970s—warned the business community that enthusiasm for ai had spiraled out of control in the 1980s and that disappointment would certainly follow. they described a chain reaction, similar to a "nuclear winter", that would begin with pessimism in the ai community, followed by pessimism in the press, followed by a severe cutback in funding, followed by the end of serious research. three years later the billion-dollar ai industry began to collapse.
there were two major winters approximately 1974–1980 and 1987–2000, and several smaller episodes, including the following:
enthusiasm and optimism about ai has generally increased since its low point in the early 1990s. beginning about 2012, interest in artificial intelligence (and especially the sub-field of machine learning) from the research and corporate communities led to a dramatic increase in funding and investment, leading to the current (as of 2024) ai boom.
machine translation and the alpac report of 1966
natural language processing (nlp) research has its roots in the early 1930s and began its existence with the work on machine translation (mt). however, significant advancements and applications began to emerge after the publication of warren weaver's influential memorandum in 1949. the memorandum generated great excitement within the research community. in the following years, notable events unfolded: ibm embarked on the development of the first machine, mit appointed its first full-time professor in machine translation, and several conferences dedicated to mt took place. the culmination came with the public demonstration of the ibm-georgetown machine, which garnered widespread attention in respected newspapers in 1954.
just like all ai booms that have been followed by desperate ai winters, the media tended to exaggerate the significance of these developments. headlines about the ibm-georgetown experiment proclaimed phrases like "the bilingual machine," "robot brain translates russian into king's english," and "polyglot brainchild." however, the actual demonstration involved the translation of a curated set of only 49 russian sentences into english, with the machine's vocabulary limited to just 250 words. to put things into perspective, a 2006 study made by paul nation found that humans need a vocabulary of around 8,000 to 9,000-word families to comprehend written texts with 98% accuracy.
during the cold war, the us government was particularly interested in the automatic, instant translation of russian documents and scientific reports. the government aggressively supported efforts at machine translation starting in 1954. another factor that propelled the field of mechanical translation was the interest shown by the central intelligence agency (cia). during that period, the cia firmly believed in the importance of developing machine translation capabilities and supported such initiatives. they also recognized that this program had implications that extended beyond the interests of the cia and the intelligence community.
at the outset, the researchers were optimistic. noam chomsky's new work in grammar was streamlining the translation process and there were "many predictions of imminent 'breakthroughs'".however, researchers had underestimated the profound difficulty of word-sense disambiguation. in order to translate a sentence, a machine needed to have some idea what the sentence was about, otherwise it made mistakes. an apocryphal example is "the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak." translated back and forth with russian, it became "the vodka is good but the meat is rotten." later researchers would call this the commonsense knowledge problem.
by 1964, the national research council had become concerned about the lack of progress and formed the automatic language processing advisory committee (alpac) to look into the problem. they concluded, in a famous 1966 report, that machine translation was more expensive, less accurate and slower than human translation. after spending some 20 million dollars, the nrc ended all support. careers were destroyed and research ended.
machine translation shared the same path with nlp from the rule-based approaches through the statistical approaches up to the neural network approaches, which have in 2023 culminated in large language models.
the failure of single-layer neural networks in 1969
simple networks or circuits of connected units, including walter pitts and warren mcculloch's neural network for logic and marvin minsky's snarc system, have failed to deliver the promised results and were abandoned in the late 1950s. following the success of programs such as the logic theorist and the general problem solver, algorithms for manipulating symbols seemed more promising at the time as means to achieve logical reasoning viewed at the time as the essence of intelligence, either natural or artificial. 
interest in perceptrons, invented by frank rosenblatt, was kept alive only by the sheer force of his personality.
he optimistically predicted that the perceptron "may eventually be able to learn, make decisions, and translate languages".
mainstream research into perceptrons ended partially because the 1969 book perceptrons by marvin minsky and seymour papert emphasized the limits of what perceptrons could do. while it was already known that multilayered perceptrons are not subject to the criticism, nobody in the 1960s knew how to train a multilayered perceptron. backpropagation was still years away.
major funding for projects neural network approaches was difficult to find in the 1970s and early 1980s. important theoretical work continued despite the lack of funding. the "winter" of neural network approach came to an end in the middle 1980s, when the work of john hopfield, david rumelhart and others revived large scale interest. rosenblatt did not live to see this, however, as he died in a boating accident shortly after perceptrons was published.
in 1973, professor sir james lighthill was asked by the uk parliament to evaluate the state of ai research in the united kingdom. his report, now called the lighthill report, criticized the utter failure of ai to achieve its "grandiose objectives". he concluded that nothing being done in ai could not be done in other sciences. he specifically mentioned the problem of "combinatorial explosion" or "intractability", which implied that many of ai's most successful algorithms would grind to a halt on real world problems and were only suitable for solving "toy" versions.
the report was contested in a debate broadcast in the bbc "controversy" series in 1973. the debate "the general purpose robot is a mirage" from the royal institution was lighthill versus the team of donald michie, john mccarthy and richard gregory. mccarthy later wrote that "the combinatorial explosion problem has been recognized in ai from the beginning".
the report led to the complete dismantling of ai research in the uk. ai research continued in only a few universities (edinburgh, essex and sussex). research would not revive on a large scale until 1983, when alvey (a research project of the british government) began to fund ai again from a war chest of £350 million in response to the japanese fifth generation project (see below). alvey had a number of uk-only requirements which did not sit well internationally, especially with us partners, and lost phase 2 funding.
darpa's early 1970s funding cuts
during the 1960s, the defense advanced research projects agency (then known as "arpa", now known as "darpa") provided millions of dollars for ai research with few strings attached. j. c. r. licklider, the founding director of darpa's computing division, believed in "funding people, not projects" and he and several successors allowed ai's leaders (such as marvin minsky, john mccarthy, herbert a. simon or allen newell) to spend it almost any way they liked.
this attitude changed after the passage of mansfield amendment in 1969, which required darpa to fund "mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research". pure undirected research of the kind that had gone on in the 1960s would no longer be funded by darpa. researchers now had to show that their work would soon produce some useful military technology. ai research proposals were held to a very high standard. the situation was not helped when the lighthill report and darpa's own study (the american study group) suggested that most ai research was unlikely to produce anything truly useful in the foreseeable future. darpa's money was directed at specific projects with identifiable goals, such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems. by 1974, funding for ai projects was hard to find.
ai researcher hans moravec blamed the crisis on the unrealistic predictions of his colleagues: "many researchers were caught up in a web of increasing exaggeration. their initial promises to darpa had been much too optimistic. of course, what they delivered stopped considerably short of that. but they felt they couldn't in their next proposal promise less than in the first one, so they promised more." the result, moravec claims, is that some of the staff at darpa had lost patience with ai research. "it was literally phrased at darpa that 'some of these people were going to be taught a lesson [by] having their two-million-dollar-a-year contracts cut to almost nothing!'" moravec told daniel crevier.
while the autonomous tank project was a failure, the battle management system (the dynamic analysis and replanning tool) proved to be enormously successful, saving billions in the first gulf war, repaying all of darpas investment in ai and justifying darpa's pragmatic policy.
in 1971, the defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) began an ambitious five-year experiment in speech understanding. the goals of the project were to provide recognition of utterances from a limited vocabulary in near-real time. three organizations finally demonstrated systems at the conclusion of the project in 1976. these were carnegie-mellon university (cmu), who actually demonstrated two system [hearsay-ii and harpy]; bolt, beranek and newman (bbn); and system development corporation with stanford research institute (sdc/sri)
the system that came closest to satisfying the original project goals was the cmu harpy system. the relatively high performance of the harpy system was largely achieved through 'hard-wiring' information about possible utterances into the system's knowledge base. although harpy made some interesting contributions, its dependence on extensive pre-knowledge limited the applicability of the approach to other signal-understanding tasks.
darpa was deeply disappointed with researchers working on the speech understanding research program at carnegie mellon university. darpa had hoped for, and felt it had been promised, a system that could respond to voice commands from a pilot. the sur team had developed a system which could recognize spoken english, but only if the words were spoken in a particular order. darpa felt it had been duped and, in 1974, they cancelled a three million dollar a year contract.
many years later, several successful commercial speech recognition systems would use the technology developed by the carnegie mellon team (such as hidden markov models) and the market for speech recognition systems would reach $4 billion by 2001.

reddy gives a review of progress in speech understanding at the end of the darpa project in a 1976 article in proceedings of the ieee.
thomas haigh argues that activity in the domain of ai did not slow down, even as funding from dod was being redirected, mostly in the wake of congressional legislation meant to separate military and academic activities. that indeed professional interest was growing throughout the 70s. using the membership count of acm's sigart, the special interest group on artificial intelligence, as a proxy for interest in the subject, the author writes: (...) i located two data sources, neither of which supports the idea of a broadly based ai winter during the 1970s. one is membership of acm's sigart, the major venue for sharing news and research abstracts during the 1970s. when the lighthill report was published in 1973 the fast-growing group had 1,241 members, approximately twice the level in 1969. the next five years are conventionally thought of as the darkest part of the first ai winter. was the ai community shrinking? no! by mid-1978 sigart membership had almost tripled, to 3,500. not only was the group growing faster than ever, it was increasing proportionally faster than acm as a whole which had begun to plateau (expanding by less than 50% over the entire period from 1969 to 1978). one in every 11 acm members was in sigart.
the setbacks of the late 1980s and early 1990s
the collapse of the lisp machine market
in the 1980s, a form of ai program called an "expert system" was adopted by corporations around the world. the first commercial expert system was xcon, developed at carnegie mellon for digital equipment corporation, and it was an enormous success: it was estimated to have saved the company 40 million dollars over just six years of operation. corporations around the world began to develop and deploy expert systems and by 1985 they were spending over a billion dollars on ai, most of it to in-house ai departments. an industry grew up to support them, including software companies like teknowledge and intellicorp (kee), and hardware companies like symbolics and lisp machines inc. who built specialized computers, called lisp machines, that were optimized to process the programming language lisp, the preferred language for ai research in the usa.
in 1987, three years after minsky and schank's prediction, the market for specialized lisp-based ai hardware collapsed. workstations by companies like sun microsystems offered a powerful alternative to lisp machines and companies like lucid offered a lisp environment for this new class of workstations. the performance of these general workstations became an increasingly difficult challenge for lisp machines. companies like lucid and franz lisp offered increasingly powerful versions of lisp that were portable to all unix systems. for example, benchmarks were published showing workstations maintaining a performance advantage over lisp machines. later desktop computers built by apple and ibm would also offer a simpler and more popular architecture to run lisp applications on. by 1987, some of them had become as powerful as the more expensive lisp machines. the desktop computers had rule-based engines such as clips available. these alternatives left consumers with no reason to buy an expensive machine specialized for running lisp. an entire industry worth half a billion dollars was replaced in a single year.
by the early 1990s, most commercial lisp companies had failed, including symbolics, lisp machines inc., lucid inc., etc. other companies, like texas instruments and xerox, abandoned the field. a small number of customer companies (that is, companies using systems written in lisp and developed on lisp machine platforms) continued to maintain systems. in some cases, this maintenance involved the assumption of the resulting support work.
slowdown in deployment of expert systems
by the early 1990s, the earliest successful expert systems, such as xcon, proved too expensive to maintain. they were difficult to update, they could not learn, they were "brittle" (i.e., they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs), and they fell prey to problems (such as the qualification problem) that had been identified years earlier in research in nonmonotonic logic. expert systems proved useful, but only in a few special contexts. another problem dealt with the computational hardness of truth maintenance efforts for general knowledge. kee used an assumption-based approach supporting multiple-world scenarios that was difficult to understand and apply.
the few remaining expert system shell companies were eventually forced to downsize and search for new markets and software paradigms, like case-based reasoning or universal database access. the maturation of common lisp saved many systems such as icad which found application in knowledge-based engineering. other systems, such as intellicorp's kee, moved from lisp to a c++ (variant) on the pc and helped establish object-oriented technology (including providing major support for the development of uml (see uml partners).
the end of the fifth generation project
in 1981, the japanese ministry of international trade and industry set aside $850 million for the fifth generation computer project. their objectives were to write programs and build machines that could carry on conversations, translate languages, interpret pictures, and reason like human beings. by 1991, the impressive list of goals penned in 1981 had not been met. according to hp newquist in the brain makers, "on june 1, 1992, the fifth generation project ended not with a successful roar, but with a whimper." as with other ai projects, expectations had run much higher than what was actually possible.
strategic computing initiative cutbacks
in 1983, in response to the fifth generation project, darpa again began to fund ai research through the strategic computing initiative. as originally proposed the project would begin with practical, achievable goals, which even included artificial general intelligence as long-term objective. the program was under the direction of the information processing technology office (ipto) and was also directed at supercomputing and microelectronics. by 1985 it had spent $100 million and 92 projects were underway at 60 institutions, half in industry, half in universities and government labs. ai research was well-funded by the sci.
jack schwarz, who ascended to the leadership of ipto in 1987, dismissed expert systems as "clever programming" and cut funding to ai "deeply and brutally", "eviscerating" sci. schwarz felt that darpa should focus its funding only on those technologies which showed the most promise, in his words, darpa should "surf", rather than "dog paddle", and he felt strongly ai was not "the next wave". insiders in the program cited problems in communication, organization and integration. a few projects survived the funding cuts, including pilot's assistant and an autonomous land vehicle (which were never delivered) and the dart battle management system, which (as noted above) was successful.
ai winter of the 1990's and early 2000's
a survey of reports from the early 2000's suggests that ai's reputation was still poor:
alex castro, quoted in the economist, 7 june 2007: "[investors] were put off by the term 'voice recognition' which, like 'artificial intelligence', is associated with systems that have all too often failed to live up to their promises."
patty tascarella in pittsburgh business times, 2006: "some believe the word 'robotics' actually carries a stigma that hurts a company's chances at funding."
john markoff in the new york times, 2005: "at its low point, some computer scientists and software engineers avoided the term artificial intelligence for fear of being viewed as wild-eyed dreamers."
many researchers in ai in the mid 2000's deliberately called their work by other names, such as informatics, machine learning, analytics, knowledge-based systems, business rules management, cognitive systems, intelligent systems, intelligent agents or computational intelligence, to indicate that their work emphasizes particular tools or is directed at a particular sub-problem. although this may be partly because they consider their field to be fundamentally different from ai, it is also true that the new names help to procure funding by avoiding the stigma of false promises attached to the name "artificial intelligence".
in the late 1990's and early 21st century, ai technology became widely used as elements of larger systems, but the field is rarely credited for these successes. in 2006, nick bostrom explained that "a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications, often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled ai anymore." rodney brooks stated around the same time that "there's this stupid myth out there that ai has failed, but ai is around you every second of the day."
current ai spring (2022–present)
ai has reached the highest levels of interest and funding in its history in the past few years by every possible measure, including: 
the successes of the current "ai spring" or "ai boom" are advances in language translation (in particular, google translate), image recognition (spurred by the imagenet training database) as commercialized by google image search, and in game-playing systems such as alphazero (chess champion) and alphago (go champion), and watson (jeopardy champion). a turning point was in 2012 when alexnet (a deep learning network) won the imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge with half as many errors as the second place winner.
the 2022 release of openai's ai chatbot chatgpt which as of january 2023 has over 100 million users, has reinvigorated the discussion about artificial intelligence and its effects on the world.

at&t labs, inc. (formerly at&t laboratories, inc.) is the research & development division of at&t, the telecommunications company. it employs some 1,800 people in various locations, including: bedminster nj; middletown, nj; manhattan, ny; warrenville, il; austin, tx; dallas, tx; atlanta, ga; san francisco, ca; san ramon, ca; and redmond, wa. the main research division, made up of around 450 people, is based across the bedminster, middletown, san francisco, and manhattan locations.
at&t labs traces its history from at&t bell labs. much research is in areas traditionally associated with networks and systems, ranging from the physics of optical transmission to foundational topics in computing and communications. other research areas address the technical challenges of large operational networks and the resulting large data sets.
researchers at at&t labs wrote hancock, a data mining language that sorted through 100 million records nightly from the parent company's long-distance phone network. the online encyclopedia of integer sequences (now operated by the oeis foundation) is the creation of former at&t researcher neil sloane. 
researchers at at&t labs have successfully transmitted 100 gigabits per second over a single optical link. in 2009, at&t researchers led the winning team in the netflix prize competition for helping to improve netflix's movie recommendation algorithm.
at&t laboratories, inc., known informally as at&t labs, was founded in 1996, as a result of the split of at&t bell laboratories into separate r&d organizations supporting at&t corporation and lucent technologies. lucent retained the name bell labs and at&t adopted the name at&t laboratories for its r&d organization.
at&t labs also traces its origin to southwestern bell technology resources, inc. (swb tri) which was founded in 1988 as the r&d arm of southwestern bell corporation. it had no connection to bellcore, the r&d organization owned equally by all of the baby bells.
in 1995, southwestern bell corporation renamed itself sbc communications, inc., resulting in the subsequent name changes of companies such as swb tri to sbc technology resources, inc. (sbc tri).
in 2003, sbc tri changed its name to sbc laboratories, inc.. sbc laboratories focused on four core areas: broadband internet, wireless systems, network services, and network it.
in 2005, sbc communications and at&t corporation merged to form at&t. at&t labs, inc. became the new name of the combined sbc laboratories, inc. and at&t laboratories along with its research facilities in new jersey.
in 2006, bellsouth telecommunications science and technology (s&t) was also merged with at&t labs.  bellsouth science and technology had offices in birmingham, alabama and atlanta, georgia.

action selection is a way of characterizing the most basic problem of intelligent systems: what to do next. in artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science, "the action selection problem" is typically associated with intelligent agents and animats—artificial systems that exhibit complex behaviour in an agent environment. the term is also sometimes used in ethology or animal behavior.
one problem for understanding action selection is determining the level of abstraction used for specifying an "act". at the most basic level of abstraction, an atomic act could be anything from contracting a muscle cell to provoking a war. typically for any one action-selection mechanism, the set of possible actions is predefined and fixed.
most researchers working in this field place high demands on their agents:
the acting agent typically must select its action in dynamic and unpredictable environments.
the agents typically act in real time; therefore they must make decisions in a timely fashion.
the agents are normally created to perform several different tasks. these tasks may conflict for resource allocation (e.g. can the agent put out a fire and deliver a cup of coffee at the same time?)
the environment the agents operate in may include humans, who may make things more difficult for the agent (either intentionally or by attempting to assist.)
the agents themselves are often intended to model animals or humans, and animal/human behaviour is quite complicated.
for these reasons action selection is not trivial and attracts a good deal of research.
characteristics of the action selection problem
the main problem for action selection is complexity. since all computation takes both time and space (in memory), agents cannot possibly consider every option available to them at every instant in time. consequently, they must be biased, and constrain their search in some way. for ai, the question of action selection is what is the best way to constrain this search? for biology and ethology, the question is how do various types of animals constrain their search? do all animals use the same approaches? why do they use the ones they do?
one fundamental question about action selection is whether it is really a problem at all for an agent, or whether it is just a description of an emergent property of an intelligent agent's behavior. however, if we consider how we are going to build an intelligent agent, then it becomes apparent there must be some mechanism for action selection. this mechanism may be highly distributed (as in the case of distributed organisms such as social insect colonies or slime mold) or it may be a special-purpose module.
the action selection mechanism (asm) determines not only the agent's actions in terms of impact on the world, but also directs its perceptual attention, and updates its memory. these egocentric sorts of actions may in turn result in modifying the agent's basic behavioural capacities, particularly in that updating memory implies some form of machine learning is possible. ideally, action selection itself should also be able to learn and adapt, but there are many problems of combinatorial complexity and computational tractability that may require restricting the search space for learning.
in ai, an asm is also sometimes either referred to as an agent architecture or thought of as a substantial part of one.
generally, artificial action selection mechanisms can be divided into several categories: symbol-based systems sometimes known as classical planning, distributed solutions, and reactive or dynamic planning. some approaches do not fall neatly into any one of these categories. others are really more about providing scientific models than practical ai control; these last are described further in the next section.
early in the history of artificial intelligence, it was assumed that the best way for an agent to choose what to do next would be to compute a probably optimal plan, and then execute that plan. this led to the physical symbol system hypothesis, that a physical agent that can manipulate symbols is necessary and sufficient for intelligence. many software agents still use this approach for action selection. it normally requires describing all sensor readings, the world, all of ones actions and all of one's goals in some form of predicate logic. critics of this approach complain that it is too slow for real-time planning and that, despite the proofs, it is still unlikely to produce optimal plans because reducing descriptions of reality to logic is a process prone to errors.
satisficing is a decision-making strategy that attempts to meet criteria for adequacy, rather than identify an optimal solution. a satisficing strategy may often, in fact, be (near) optimal if the costs of the decision-making process itself, such as the cost of obtaining complete information, are considered in the outcome calculus.
goal driven architectures – in these symbolic architectures, the agent's behaviour is typically described by a set of goals. each goal can be achieved by a process or an activity, which is described by a prescripted plan. the agent must just decide which process to carry on to accomplish a given goal. the plan can expand to subgoals, which makes the process slightly recursive. technically, more or less, the plans exploits condition-rules. these architectures are reactive or hybrid. classical examples of goal driven architectures are implementable refinements of belief-desire-intention architecture like jam or ive.
in contrast to the symbolic approach, distributed systems of action selection actually have no one "box" in the agent which decides the next action. at least in their idealized form, distributed systems have many modules running in parallel and determining the best action based on local expertise. in these idealized systems, overall coherence is expected to emerge somehow, possibly through careful design of the interacting components. this approach is often inspired by artificial neural networks research. in practice, there is almost always some centralised system determining which module is "the most active" or has the most salience. there is evidence real biological brains also have such executive decision systems which evaluate which of the competing systems deserves the most attention, or more properly, has its desired actions disinhibited.
asmo is an attention-based architecture developed by mary-anne williams, benjamin johnston and their phd student rony novianto. it orchestrates a diversity of modular distributed processes that can use their own representations and techniques to perceive the environment, process information, plan actions and propose actions to perform.
various types of winner-take-all architectures, in which the single selected action takes full control of the motor system
spreading activation including maes nets (ana)
extended rosenblatt & payton is a spreading activation architecture developed by toby tyrrell in 1993. the agent's behaviour is stored in the form of a hierarchical connectionism network, which tyrrell named free-flow hierarchy. recently exploited for example by de sevin & thalmann (2005) or kadleček (2001).
behavior based ai, was a response to the slow speed of robots using symbolic action selection techniques. in this form, separate modules respond to different stimuli and generate their own responses. in the original form, the subsumption architecture, these consisted of different layers which could monitor and suppress each other's inputs and outputs.
creatures are virtual pets from a computer game driven by three-layered neural network, which is adaptive. their mechanism is reactive since the network at every time step determines the task that has to be performed by the pet. the network is described well in the paper of grand et al. (1997) and in the creatures developer resources. see also the creatures wiki.
because purely distributed systems are difficult to construct, many researchers have turned to using explicit hard-coded plans to determine the priorities of their system.
dynamic or reactive planning methods compute just one next action in every instant based on the current context and pre-scripted plans. in contrast to classical planning methods, reactive or dynamic approaches do not suffer combinatorial explosion. on the other hand, they are sometimes seen as too rigid to be considered strong ai, since the plans are coded in advance. at the same time, natural intelligence can be rigid in some contexts although it is fluid and able to adapt in others.
example dynamic planning mechanisms include:
finite-state machines these are reactive architectures used mostly for computer game agents, in particular for first-person shooters bots, or for virtual movie actors. typically, the state-machines are hierarchical. for concrete game examples, see halo 2 bots paper by damian isla (2005) or the master's thesis about quake iii bots by jan paul van waveren (2001). for a movie example, see softimage.
other structured reactive plans tend to look a little more like conventional plans, often with ways to represent hierarchical and sequential structure. some, such as prs's 'acts', have support for partial plans. many agent architectures from the mid-1990s included such plans as a "middle layer" that provided organization for low-level behavior modules while being directed by a higher level real-time planner. despite this supposed interoperability with automated planners, most structured reactive plans are hand coded (bryson 2001, ch. 3). examples of structured reactive plans include james firby's rap system and the nils nilsson's teleo-reactive plans. prs, raps & trp are no longer developed or supported. one still-active (as of 2006) descendant of this approach is the parallel-rooted ordered slip-stack hierarchical (or posh) action selection system, which is a part of joanna bryson's behaviour oriented design.
sometimes to attempt to address the perceived inflexibility of dynamic planning, hybrid techniques are used. in these, a more conventional ai planning system searches for new plans when the agent has spare time, and updates the dynamic plan library when it finds good solutions. the important aspect of any such system is that when the agent needs to select an action, some solution exists that can be used immediately (see further anytime algorithm).
cognitao is a decision making engine it based on bdi (belief-desire-intention), it includes built in teamwork capabilities.
soar is a symbolic cognitive architecture. it is based on condition-action rules known as productions. programmers can use the soar development toolkit for building both reactive and planning agents, or any compromise between these two extremes.
excalibur was a research project led by alexander nareyek featuring any-time planning agents for computer games. the architecture is based on structural constraint satisfaction, which is an advanced artificial intelligence technique.
act-r is similar to soar. it includes a bayesian learning system to help prioritize the productions.
fuzzy architectures the fuzzy approach in action selection produces more smooth behaviour than can be produced by architectures exploiting boolean condition-action rules (like soar or posh). these architectures are mostly reactive and symbolic.
theories of action selection in nature
many dynamic models of artificial action selection were originally inspired by research in ethology. in particular, konrad lorenz and nikolaas tinbergen provided the idea of an innate releasing mechanism to explain instinctive behaviors (fixed action patterns). influenced by the ideas of william mcdougall, lorenz developed this into a "psychohydraulic" model of the motivation of behavior. in ethology, these ideas were influential in the 1960s, but they are now regarded as outdated because of their use of an energy flow metaphor; the nervous system and the control of behavior are now normally treated as involving information transmission rather than energy flow. dynamic plans and neural networks are more similar to information transmission, while spreading activation is more similar to the diffuse control of emotional / hormonal systems.
stan franklin has proposed that action selection is the right perspective to take in understanding the role and evolution of mind. see his page on the action selection paradigm. archived 2006-10-09 at the wayback machine
ai models of neural action selection
some researchers create elaborate models of neural action selection. see for example:
the computational cognitive neuroscience lab (cu boulder).
the adaptive behaviour research group (sheffield).
catecholaminergic neuron electron transport (cnet)
the locus coeruleus (lc) is one of the primary sources of noradrenaline in the brain, and has been associated with selection of cognitive processing, such as attention and behavioral tasks. the substantia nigra pars compacta (snc) is one of the primary sources of dopamine in the brain, and has been associated with action selection, primarily as part of the basal ganglia.  cnet is a hypothesized neural signaling mechanism in the snc and lc (which are catecholaminergic neurons), that could assist with action selection by routing energy between neurons in each group as part of action selection, to help one or more neurons in each group to reach action potential. it was first proposed in 2018, and is based on a number of physical parameters of those neurons, which can be broken down into three major components:
while evidence of a number of physical predictions of the cnet hypothesis has thus been obtained, evidence of whether the hypothesis itself is correct has not been sought. one way to try to determine whether the cnet mechanism is present in these neurons would be to use quantum dot fluorophores and optical probes to determine whether electron tunneling associated with ferritin in the neurons is occurring in association with specific actions.

the activation function of a node in an artificial neural network is a function that calculates the output of the node based on its individual inputs and their weights. nontrivial problems can be solved using only a few nodes if the activation function is nonlinear. modern activation functions include the smooth version of the relu, the gelu, which was used in the 2018 bert model, the logistic (sigmoid) function used in the 2012 speech recognition model developed by hinton et al, the relu used in the 2012 alexnet computer vision model and in the 2015 resnet model.
comparison of activation functions
aside from their empirical performance, activation functions also have different mathematical properties:
when the activation function is non-linear, then a two-layer neural network can be proven to be a universal function approximator. this is known as the universal approximation theorem. the identity activation function does not satisfy this property. when multiple layers use the identity activation function, the entire network is equivalent to a single-layer model.
when the range of the activation function is finite, gradient-based training methods tend to be more stable, because pattern presentations significantly affect only limited weights. when the range is infinite, training is generally more efficient because pattern presentations significantly affect most of the weights. in the latter case, smaller learning rates are typically necessary.
this property is desirable (relu is not continuously differentiable and has some issues with gradient-based optimization, but it is still possible) for enabling gradient-based optimization methods. the binary step activation function is not differentiable at 0, and it differentiates to 0 for all other values, so gradient-based methods can make no progress with it.
these properties do not decisively influence performance, nor are they the only mathematical properties that may be useful. for instance, the strictly positive range of the softplus makes it suitable for predicting variances in variational autoencoders.
the most common activation functions can be divided into three categories: ridge functions, radial functions and fold functions.
ridge functions are multivariate functions acting on a linear combination of the input variables. often used examples include:
in biologically inspired neural networks, the activation function is usually an abstraction representing the rate of action potential firing in the cell. in its simplest form, this function is binary—that is, either the neuron is firing or not. neurons also cannot fire faster than a certain rate, motivating sigmoid activation functions whose range is a finite interval. 
if a line has a positive slope, on the other hand, it may reflect the increase in firing rate that occurs as input current increases. such a function would be of the form 
a special class of activation functions known as radial basis functions (rbfs) are used in rbf networks, which are extremely efficient as universal function approximators. these activation functions can take many forms, but they are usually found as one of the following functions:
folding activation functions are extensively used in the pooling layers in convolutional neural networks, and in output layers of multiclass classification networks. these activations perform aggregation over the inputs, such as taking the mean, minimum or maximum. in multiclass classification the softmax activation is often used.
the following table compares the properties of several activation functions that are functions of one fold x from the previous layer or layers:
the following table lists activation functions that are not functions of a single fold x from the previous layer or layers:
in quantum neural networks programmed on gate-model quantum computers, based on quantum perceptrons instead of variational quantum circuits, the non-linearity of the activation function can be implemented with no need of measuring the output of each perceptron at each layer. the quantum properties loaded within the circuit such as superposition can be preserved by creating the taylor series of the argument computed by the perceptron itself, with suitable quantum circuits computing the powers up to a wanted approximation degree. because of the flexibility of such quantum circuits, they can be designed in order to approximate any arbitrary classical activation function.
active learning is a special case of machine learning in which a learning algorithm can interactively query a human user (or some other information source), to label new data points with the desired outputs. the human user must possess knowledge/expertise in the problem domain, including the ability to consult/research authoritative sources when necessary.  in statistics literature, it is sometimes also called optimal experimental design. the information source is also called teacher or oracle.
there are situations in which unlabeled data is abundant but manual labeling is expensive. in such a scenario, learning algorithms can actively query the user/teacher for labels. this type of iterative supervised learning is called active learning. since the learner chooses the examples, the number of examples to learn a concept can often be much lower than the number required in normal supervised learning. with this approach, there is a risk that the algorithm is overwhelmed by uninformative examples.  recent developments are dedicated to multi-label active learning, hybrid active learning and active learning in a single-pass (on-line) context, combining concepts from the field of machine learning (e.g. conflict and ignorance) with adaptive, incremental learning policies in the field of online machine learning. using active learning allows for faster development of a machine learning algorithm, when comparative updates would require a quantum or super computer.
large-scale active learning projects may benefit from crowdsourcing frameworks such as amazon mechanical turk that include many humans in the active learning loop.
let t be the total set of all data under consideration. for example, in a protein engineering problem, t would include all proteins that are known to have a certain interesting activity and all additional proteins that one might want to test for that activity.
during each iteration, i, t is broken up into three subsets
most of the current research in active learning involves the best method to choose the data points for tc,i.
pool-based sampling: in this approach, which is the most well known scenario, the learning algorithm attempts to evaluate the entire dataset before selecting data points (instances) for labeling. it is often initially trained on a fully labeled subset of the data using a machine-learning method such as logistic regression or svm that yields class-membership probabilities for individual data instances. the candidate instances are those for which the prediction is most ambiguous. instances are drawn from the entire data pool and assigned a confidence score, a measurement of how well the learner "understands" the data. the system then selects the instances for which it is the least confident and queries the teacher for the labels. the theoretical drawback of pool-based sampling is that it is memory-intensive and is therefore limited in its capacity to handle enormous datasets, but in practice, the rate-limiting factor is that the teacher is typically a (fatiguable) human expert who must be paid for their effort, rather than computer memory.
stream-based selective sampling: here, each consecutive unlabeled instance is examined one at a time with the machine evaluating the informativeness of each item against its query parameters. the learner decides for itself whether to assign a label or query the teacher for each datapoint. as contrasted with pool-based sampling, the obvious drawback of stream-based methods is that the learning algorithm does not have sufficient information, early in the process, to make a sound assign-label-vs ask-teacher decision, and it does not capitalize as efficiently on the presence of already labeled data. therefore, the teacher is likely to spend more effort in supplying labels than with the pool-based approach.
membership query synthesis: this is where the learner generates synthetic data from an underlying natural distribution. for example, if the dataset are pictures of humans and animals, the learner could send a clipped image of a leg to the teacher and query if this appendage belongs to an animal or human. this is particularly useful if the dataset is small. the challenge here, as with all synthetic-data-generation efforts, is in ensuring that the synthetic data is consistent in terms of meeting the constraints on real data. as the number of variables/features in the input data increase, and strong dependencies between variables exist, it becomes increasingly difficult to generate synthetic data with sufficient fidelity. for example, to create a synthetic data set for human laboratory-test values, the sum of the various white blood cell (wbc) components in a white blood cell differential must equal 100, since the component numbers are really percentages. similarly, the enzymes alanine transaminase (alt) and aspartate transaminase (ast) measure liver function (though ast is also produced by other tissues, e.g., lung, pancreas) a synthetic data point with ast at the lower limit of normal range (8-33 units/l) with an alt several times above normal range (4-35 units/l) in a simulated chronically ill patient would be physiologically impossible.
algorithms for determining which data points should be labeled can be organized into a number of different categories, based upon their purpose:
balance exploration and exploitation: the choice of examples to label is seen as a dilemma between the exploration and the exploitation over the data space representation. this strategy manages this compromise by modelling the active learning problem as a contextual bandit problem. for example, bouneffouf et al. propose a sequential algorithm named active thompson sampling (ats), which, in each round, assigns a sampling distribution on the pool, samples one point from this distribution, and queries the oracle for this sample point label.
expected model change: label those points that would most change the current model.
expected error reduction: label those points that would most reduce the model's generalization error.
exponentiated gradient exploration for active learning: in this paper, the author proposes a sequential algorithm named exponentiated gradient (eg)-active that can improve any active learning algorithm by an optimal random exploration.
random sampling: a sample is randomly selected.
uncertainty sampling: label those points for which the current model is least certain as to what the correct output should be.
entropy sampling: the entropy formula is used on each sample, and the sample with the highest entropy is considered to be the least certain.
margin sampling: the sample with the smallest difference between the two highest class probabilities is considered to be the most uncertain.
least confident sampling: the sample with the smallest best probability is considered to be the most uncertain.
query by committee: a variety of models are trained on the current labeled data, and vote on the output for unlabeled data; label those points for which the "committee" disagrees the most
querying from diverse subspaces or partitions: when the underlying model is a forest of trees, the leaf nodes might represent (overlapping) partitions of the original feature space. this offers the possibility of selecting instances from non-overlapping or minimally overlapping partitions for labeling.
variance reduction: label those points that would minimize output variance, which is one of the components of error.
conformal prediction: predicts that a new data point will have a label similar to old data points in some specified way and degree of the similarity within the old examples is used to estimate the confidence in the prediction.
mismatch-first farthest-traversal: the primary selection criterion is the prediction mismatch between the current model and nearest-neighbour prediction. it targets on wrongly predicted data points. the second selection criterion is the distance to previously selected data, the farthest first. it aims at optimizing the diversity of selected data.
user centered labeling strategies: learning is accomplished by applying dimensionality reduction to graphs and figures like scatter plots. then the user is asked to label the compiled data (categorical, numerical, relevance scores, relation between two instances.
a wide variety of algorithms have been studied that fall into these categories. while the  traditional al  strategies can  achieve  remarkable  performance, it  is often challenging to predict in advance which strategy is the most suitable in aparticular situation. in recent years, meta-learning algorithms have been gaining in popularity. some of them have been proposed to tackle the problem of learning al strategies instead of relying on manually designed strategies. a benchmark which compares 'meta-learning approaches to active learning' to 'traditional heuristic-based active learning' may give intuitions if 'learning active learning' is at the crossroads
some active learning algorithms are built upon support-vector machines (svms) and exploit the structure of the svm to determine which data points to label. such methods usually calculate the margin, w, of each unlabeled datum in tu,i and treat w as an n-dimensional distance from that datum to the separating hyperplane.
minimum marginal hyperplane methods assume that the data with the smallest w are those that the svm is most uncertain about and therefore should be placed in tc,i to be labeled. other similar methods, such as maximum marginal hyperplane, choose data with the largest w. tradeoff methods choose a mix of the smallest and largest ws.

an adaptive website is a website that builds a model of user activity and modifies the information and/or presentation of information to the user in order to better address the user's needs.
an adaptive website adjusts the structure, content, or presentation of information in response to measured user interaction with the site, with the objective of optimizing future user interactions. adaptive websites "are web sites that automatically improve their organization and presentation by learning from their user access patterns." user interaction patterns may be collected directly on the website or may be mined from web server logs. a model or models are created of user interaction using artificial intelligence and statistical methods. the models are used as the basis for tailoring the website for known and specific patterns of user interaction.
the collaborative filtering method: collected user data may be assessed in aggregate (across multiple users) using machine learning techniques to cluster interaction patterns to user models and classify specific user patterns to such models. the website may then be adapted to target clusters of users. in this approach, the models are explicitly created from historic user information with new users are classified to an existing model and a pre-defined mapping is used for existing content and content organization.
the statistical hypothesis testing method: a/b testing or similar methods are used in conjunction with a library of possible changes to the website or a change-generation method (such as random variation). this results in the automated process website change, impact assessment, and adoption of change. some examples include genetify for website look and feel, and snap ads for online advertising. in this approach (specifically genetify), the model is represented implicitly in the population of possible sites and adapted for all users that visit the site.
user landing pages (such as igoogle) that allow the user to customize the presented content are not adaptive websites as they rely on the user to select rather than the automation of the selection and presentation of the web widget's that appear on the website.
collaborative filtering such as recommender systems, generate and test methods such as a/b testing, and machine learning techniques such as clustering and classification that are used on a website do not make it an adaptive website. they are all tools and techniques that may be used toward engineering an adaptive website.

adversarial machine learning is the study of the attacks on machine learning algorithms, and of the defenses against such attacks. a survey from may 2020 exposes the fact that practitioners report a dire need for better protecting machine learning systems in industrial applications.
most machine learning techniques are mostly designed to work on specific problem sets, under the assumption that the training and test data are generated from the same statistical distribution (iid). however, this assumption is often dangerously violated in practical high-stake applications, where users may intentionally supply fabricated data that violates the statistical assumption.
most common attacks in adversarial machine learning include evasion attacks, data poisoning attacks, byzantine attacks and model extraction.
at the mit spam conference in january 2004, john graham-cumming showed that a machine-learning spam filter could be used to defeat another machine-learning spam filter by automatically learning which words to add to a spam email to get the email classified as not spam.
in 2004, nilesh dalvi and others noted that linear classifiers used in spam filters could be defeated by simple "evasion attacks" as spammers inserted "good words" into their spam emails. (around 2007, some spammers added random noise to fuzz words within "image spam" in order to defeat ocr-based filters.) in 2006, marco barreno and others published "can machine learning be secure?", outlining a broad taxonomy of attacks. as late as 2013 many researchers continued to hope that non-linear classifiers (such as support vector machines and neural networks) might be robust to adversaries, until battista biggio and others demonstrated the first gradient-based attacks on such machine-learning models (2012–2013). in 2012, deep neural networks began to dominate computer vision problems; starting in 2014, christian szegedy and others demonstrated that deep neural networks could be fooled by adversaries, again using a gradient-based attack to craft adversarial perturbations.
recently, it was observed that adversarial attacks are harder to produce in the practical world due to the different environmental constraints that cancel out the effect of noise. for example, any small rotation or slight illumination on an adversarial image can destroy the adversariality. in addition, researchers such as google brain's nicholas frosst point out that it is much easier to make self-driving cars miss stop signs by physically removing the sign itself, rather than creating adversarial examples. frosst also believes that the adversarial machine learning community incorrectly assumes models trained on a certain data distribution will also perform well on a completely different data distribution. he suggests that a new approach to machine learning should be explored, and is currently working on a unique neural network that has characteristics more similar to human perception than state-of-the-art approaches.
while adversarial machine learning continues to be heavily rooted in academia, large tech companies such as google, microsoft, and ibm have begun curating documentation and open source code bases to allow others to concretely assess the robustness of machine learning models and minimize the risk of adversarial attacks.
examples include attacks in spam filtering, where spam messages are obfuscated through the misspelling of "bad" words or the insertion of "good" words; attacks in computer security, such as obfuscating malware code within network packets or modifying the characteristics of a network flow to mislead intrusion detection; attacks in biometric recognition where fake biometric traits may be exploited to impersonate a legitimate user; or to compromise users' template galleries that adapt to updated traits over time.
researchers showed that by changing only one-pixel it was possible to fool deep learning algorithms. others 3-d printed a toy turtle with a texture engineered to make google's object detection ai classify it as a rifle regardless of the angle from which the turtle was viewed. creating the turtle required only low-cost commercially available 3-d printing technology.
a machine-tweaked image of a dog was shown to look like a cat to both computers and humans. a 2019 study reported that humans can guess how machines will classify adversarial images. researchers discovered methods for perturbing the appearance of a stop sign such that an autonomous vehicle classified it as a merge or speed limit sign.
mcafee attacked tesla's former mobileye system, fooling it into driving 50 mph over the speed limit, simply by adding a two-inch strip of black tape to a speed limit sign.
adversarial patterns on glasses or clothing designed to deceive facial-recognition systems or license-plate readers, have led to a niche industry of "stealth streetwear".
an adversarial attack on a neural network can allow an attacker to inject algorithms into the target system. researchers can also create adversarial audio inputs to disguise commands to intelligent assistants in benign-seeming audio; a parallel literature explores human perception of such stimuli.
clustering algorithms are used in security applications. malware and computer virus analysis aims to identify malware families, and to generate specific detection signatures.
attacks against (supervised) machine learning algorithms have been categorized along three primary axes: influence on the classifier, the security violation and their specificity.
classifier influence: an attack can influence the classifier by disrupting the classification phase. this may be preceded by an exploration phase to identify vulnerabilities. the attacker's capabilities might be restricted by the presence of data manipulation constraints.
security violation: an attack can supply malicious data that gets classified as legitimate. malicious data supplied during training can cause legitimate data to be rejected after training.
specificity: a targeted attack attempts to allow a specific intrusion/disruption. alternatively, an indiscriminate attack creates general mayhem.
this taxonomy has been extended into a more comprehensive threat model that allows explicit assumptions about the adversary's goal, knowledge of the attacked system, capability of manipulating the input data/system components, and on attack strategy. this taxonomy has further been extended to include dimensions for defense strategies against adversarial attacks.
below are some of the most commonly encountered attack scenarios.
poisoning consists of contaminating the training dataset with data designed to increase errors in the output. given that learning algorithms are shaped by their training datasets, poisoning can effectively reprogram algorithms with potentially malicious intent. concerns have been raised especially for user-generated training data, e.g. for content recommendation or natural language models. the ubiquity of fake accounts offers many opportunities for poisoning. facebook reportedly removes around 7 billion fake accounts per year. poisoning has been reported as the leading concern for industrial applications.
on social medias, disinformation campaigns attempt to bias recommendation and moderation algorithms, to push certain content over others.
a particular case of data poisoning is the backdoor attack, which aims to teach a specific behavior for inputs with a given trigger, e.g. a small defect on images, sounds, videos or texts.
for instance, intrusion detection systems are often trained using collected data. an attacker may poison this data by injecting malicious samples during operation that subsequently disrupt retraining.
data poisoning techniques can also be applied to text-to-image models to alter their output.
data poisoning can also happen unintentionally through model collapse, where models are trained on synthetic data.
as machine learning is scaled, it often relies on multiple computing machines. in federated learning, for instance, edge devices collaborate with a central server, typically by sending gradients or model parameters. however, some of these devices may deviate from their expected behavior, e.g. to harm the central server's model or to bias algorithms towards certain behaviors (e.g., amplifying the recommendation of disinformation content). on the other hand, if the training is performed on a single machine, then the model is very vulnerable to a failure of the machine, or an attack on the machine; the machine is a single point of failure. in fact, the machine owner may themselves insert provably undetectable backdoors.
the current leading solutions to make (distributed) learning algorithms provably resilient to a minority of malicious (a.k.a. byzantine) participants are based on robust gradient aggregation rules. the robust aggregation rules do not always work especially when the data across participants has a non-iid distribution. nevertheless, in the context of heterogeneous honest participants, such as users with different consumption habits for recommendation algorithms or writing styles for language models, there are provable impossibility theorems on what any robust learning algorithm can guarantee.
evasion attacks consist of exploiting the imperfection of a trained model. for instance, spammers and hackers often attempt to evade detection by obfuscating the content of spam emails and malware. samples are modified to evade detection; that is, to be classified as legitimate. this does not involve influence over the training data. a clear example of evasion is image-based spam in which the spam content is embedded within an attached image to evade textual analysis by anti-spam filters. another example of evasion is given by spoofing attacks against biometric verification systems.
evasion attacks can be generally split into two different categories: black box attacks and white box attacks.
model extraction involves an adversary probing a black box machine learning system in order to extract the data it was trained on.  this can cause issues when either the training data or the model itself is sensitive and confidential. for example, model extraction could be used to extract a proprietary stock trading model which the adversary could then use for their own financial benefit.
in the extreme case, model extraction can lead to model stealing, which corresponds to extracting a sufficient amount of data from the model to enable the complete reconstruction of the model.
on the other hand, membership inference is a targeted model extraction attack, which infers the owner of a data point, often by leveraging the overfitting resulting from poor machine learning practices. concerningly, this is sometimes achievable even without knowledge or access to a target model's parameters, raising security concerns for models trained on sensitive data, including but not limited to medical records and/or personally identifiable information. with the emergence of transfer learning and public accessibility of many state of the art machine learning models, tech companies are increasingly drawn to create models based on public ones, giving attackers freely accessible information to the structure and type of model being used.
adversarial deep reinforcement learning
adversarial deep reinforcement learning is an active area of research in reinforcement learning focusing on vulnerabilities of learned policies. in this research area, some studies initially showed that reinforcement learning policies are susceptible to imperceptible adversarial manipulations. while some methods have been proposed to overcome these susceptibilities, in the most recent studies it has been shown that these proposed solutions are far from providing an accurate representation of current vulnerabilities of deep reinforcement learning policies.
adversarial natural language processing
adversarial attacks on speech recognition have been introduced for speech-to-text applications, in particular for mozilla's implementation of deepspeech.
adversarial attacks and training in linear models
there is a growing literature about adversarial attacks in 
the analysis of these models is simplified because the computation of adversarial attacks can be simplified in linear regression and classification problems. moreover, adversarial training is convex in this case. 
linear models allow for analytical analysis while still reproducing phenomena observed in state-of-the-art models.
one prime example of that is how this model can be used to explain the trade-off between robustness and accuracy. 
diverse work indeed provides analysis of adversarial attacks in linear models, including asymptotic analysis for  classification  and for linear regression. and, finite-sample analysis based on rademacher complexity.
there are a large variety of different adversarial attacks that can be used against machine learning systems. many of these work on both deep learning systems as well as traditional machine learning models such as svms and  linear regression. a high level sample of these attack types include:
trojan attacks / backdoor attacks
an adversarial example refers to specially crafted input that is designed to look "normal" to humans but causes misclassification to a machine learning model.  often, a form of specially designed "noise"  is used to elicit the misclassifications. below are some current techniques for generating adversarial examples in the literature (by no means an exhaustive list).
fast gradient sign method (fgsm)
projected gradient descent (pgd)
carlini and wagner (c&w) attack
black box attacks in adversarial machine learning assume that the adversary can only get outputs for provided inputs and has no knowledge of the model structure or parameters. in this case, the adversarial example is generated either using a model created from scratch, or without any model at all (excluding the ability to query the original model). in either case, the objective of these attacks is to create adversarial examples that are able to transfer to the black box model in question.
simple black-box adversarial attacks
simple black-box adversarial attacks were proposed in 2019 as a query-efficient way attack black-box image classifiers. take a random orthonormal basis 
for a correctly classified image 
the square attack was introduced in 2020 as a black box evasion adversarial attack based on querying classification scores without the need of gradient information. as a score based black box attack, this adversarial approach is able to query probability distributions across model output classes, but has no other access to the model itself. according to the paper's authors, the proposed square attack required fewer queries than when compared to state-of-the-art score-based black box attacks at the time.
to describe the function objective, the attack defines the classifier as 
in other words, finding some perturbed adversarial example 
the result in theory is an adversarial example that is highly confident in the incorrect class but is also very similar to the original image. to find such example, square attack utilizes the iterative random search technique to randomly perturb the image in hopes of improving the objective function. in each step, the algorithm perturbs only a small square section of pixels, hence the name square attack, which terminates as soon as an adversarial example is found in order to improve query efficiency. finally, since the attack algorithm uses scores and not gradient information, the authors of the paper indicate that this approach is not affected by gradient masking, a common technique formerly used to prevent evasion attacks.
this black box attack was also proposed as a query efficient attack, but one that relies solely on access to any input's predicted output class. in other words, the hopskipjump attack does not require the ability to calculate gradients or access to score values like the square attack, and will require just the model's class prediction output (for any given input). the proposed attack is split into two different settings, targeted and untargeted, but both are built from the general idea of adding minimal perturbations that leads to a different model output. in the targeted setting, the goal is to cause the model to misclassify the perturbed image to a specific target label (that is not the original label). in the untargeted setting, the goal is to cause the model to misclassify the perturbed image to any label that is not the original label. the attack objectives for both are as follows where 
to solve this problem, the attack proposes the following boundary function
